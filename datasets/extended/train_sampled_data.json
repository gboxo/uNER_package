The standardised mean difference (SMD) with a random-effects model was used to analyse continuous data. For all statistical tests, significance was set atP< 0.05, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2test. P In those studies where VAS scores were reported as median, we considered the mean equivalent to the median and estimated the standard deviation (SD) using the statistical formula range/4. When the interquartile range (IQR) was determined, SD was calculated using IQR/1.35. In studies where the standard error of the mean (SEM) was used, the calculation number (n)1/2\u00d7 SEM was used to estimate SD.

Statistical heterogeneity was measured by the \u03c72test (withP< 0.1 indicating significant heterogeneity) and was described by the I2statistic.

If more than two studies of a treatment model were available, we first performed a direct comparison meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.4 software to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. Cochran\u2019s Q test and Higgin\u2019s I2test were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among the studies. If the I2was >50% or the P value was < 0.05, the studies were considered to have significant heterogeneity, and a random-effects model was used; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. The network meta-analysis was performed based on a Bayesian approach with a prior distribution [14]. The fixed-effects model was used because all treatments except nintedanib and HAIC\u2009+\u2009sorafenib were single studies, and we could not assess the heterogeneity parameters. Treatment measures were ranked according to the area under the SUCRA curve (from 0 to 1). If a treatment was closer to 1, it was more likely to be effective, and if it was closer to 0, it was likely to be less effective [15]. To explore the heterogeneity and robustness of the model results, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on a randomized phase III trial compared with the IMbrave150 study with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as the common control.

The highest and lowest values were defined by individual studies with different underlying definitions and different measurements of sedentary behaviour. Detailed definition and assessment of sedentary behaviour in individual study were summarised inonline supplemental table S3. The natural logarithms of the study-specific RR and corresponding SEs were calculated using the inverse variance approach.29Employing random effects models, the RR of each study was weighted using random effects weights and was further combined to obtain an overall estimate.

In addition, sedentary behaviour, obesity and physical activity are lifestyle factors that are complexly associated and interacted. As obesity potentially mediates the association between sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer risk, in which case the adjustment for BMI would over adjust the association, we conducted subgroup analyses stratified by whether BMI was adjusted.28Similarly, we also conducted subgroup analyses by adjusting the physical activity. Associations with total sedentary behaviour were reported in only two studies. Therefore, we also included all studies in the analysis to assess the effects of overall sedentary behaviour.

Our primary IPD-MA method will be the one-stage random-effects approach due to its ability to accommodate more advanced modelling of predictors/moderators. Furthermore, a one-stage approach is recommended for dichotomous outcomes with rare events such as PSE.22The presence of statistical heterogeneity will be calculated using I2. An I2value of 0% indicates no heterogeneity, 25% indicates low heterogeneity, 50% indicates moderate heterogeneity, and 75% indicates high heterogeneity.23Considering the clinical heterogeneity observed among the included studies, such as differences in the study population, variable length of follow-up, and variable seizure definitions, a random-effects meta-analysis was selected to account for potential statistical heterogeneity. We will utilise the DerSimonian and Laird estimator24to combine the results and apply the Hartung Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman correction to address the uncertainty.25The results will be pooled using Odds Ratio (OR), Hazard Ratio (HR), or Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). We will examine the potential for inclusion bias by reporting the characteristics of eligible studies for which IPD was requested but not obtained. If the desired results are available for these studies, we will conduct a two-stage meta-analysis using R and incorporate these results with those where IPD was obtained. Publication bias will be estimated using funnel plots and quantitatively assessed using Egger\u2019s regression test. When building PSE and outcome prediction models, we will use a multilevel mixed-effects model, using \u2018study\u2019 as one of the levels. Prognostic covariates will be added to the model based on statistical consideration; however, if we encounter a situation where many possible covariates could be added, we will only incorporate the clinically relevant covariates. We will build prediction models using the conventional forward/backward logistic regression multivariable analysis. We will test the degree of multicollinearity between the clinical covariates using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). We will remove highly correlated variables with VIF value >2.5 from the final model. Machine learning approaches readily integrate many features, in contrast to conventional predictive models that only employ a small number of variables for computation.26Few studies have incorporated prediction models, including SeLECT27and CAVE28scores, using the conventional logistic regression analysis for predicting epilepsy post-ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes. However, machine learning can potentially improve SeLECT29and CAVE\u2019s inadequate sensitivity and specificity. We will use four machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, including support vector machine,30random forest,31deep neural network,26and gradient tree boosting,32and the conventional logistic regression models. We will include the clinical predictor variables in the machine learning prediction models. The machine learning models will be trained with all clinical variables as inputs, and the study population will be classified into (a) patients with PSE and patients without PSE for identifying the predictors associated with PSE and (b) patients with PSE having poor outcomes (epilepsy outcomes, functional outcomes, mortality, etc.) and patients without PSE having poor outcomes. Specifically, for the deep neural network model, we will construct a design that includes a dropout layer. This approach is intended to facilitate the modelling of the Permutation Feature Importance, a metric that quantifies the increase in the model\u2019s prediction error after the feature\u2019s values are permuted, thereby disrupting the relationship between the feature and the true outcome. This strategy can help identify and isolate the most impactful features, contributing to the overall performance and accuracy of the prediction model. We will assess the performance of the various prediction models built using machine learning algorithms or conventional logistic regression, using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. We will conduct a full model comparison between the machine learning and conventional regression models. We will calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each model, and the best cut-off point will be determined using the maximum value of the Youden Index (sensitivity+specificity\u22121). We will calculate each prediction model\u2019s sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio. The AUC between various prediction models will be compared using the Hanley-McNeil test.33The goodness of fit between the prediction models will be assessed using the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test.34The selection of the best prediction model will be made using Akaike\u2019s Information Criteria (AIC)35and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).36AIC and BIC are methods for scoring and selecting a prediction model that best fits the dataset after correcting/penalising the model complexity, that is, adding a penalty value for the number of added parameters in the complex model compared with the simpler model. The model with less AIC or BIC value will be considered the best prediction model for the dataset. A p-value <0.05\u2009will be regarded as statistically significant in the multivariable analysis. We will test the robustness of our findings by reanalysing our main results using a two-stage random-effects IPD-MA approach. We will examine and compare the differences between one-stage and two-stage IPD-MA approaches.37We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the various sources of heterogeneity, including study-level characteristics such as follow-up duration, risk of bias, publication year, and study country. We will assess the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology.38 39 We will validate the IPD datasets by conducting internal and external validation of the prognostic models.

A logarithmical transformation was performed on the RR and its corresponding standard error from each study to stabilize and normalize its variance[19]. In order to estimate between-study heterogeneity, the CochraneQtest and theI2statistic[20] were used. AnI2> 50% indicates that there is significant heterogeneity between studies. The utilization of a random-effects model was employed to amalgamate the findings, as it has been acknowledged to encompass the impact of potential heterogeneity[17]. In order to assess the impact of individual studies on the meta-analysis outcomes, sensitivity analyses were conducted by eliminating one dataset at a time[21]. To ascertain the effect of study characteristics on the outcome, subgroup analyses were executed based on the study country, design, patient diagnosis, cutoffs of copeptin, follow-up duration, and study quality scores. The subgroups were defined based on the medians of continuous variables. A funnel plot was used to estimate publication bias based on visual judgments of symmetry, along with Egger\u2019s regression asymmetry test[22].

We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis in which all the participants who were initially randomized were included in the analyses according to the groups to which they were assigned. The effect of RAT on the outcomes of each functional domain was assessed using the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD). In cases in which a singular type of outcome was drawn for a particular domain, MD was used. To account for the variability between studies, we used a random-effects model to calculate the pooled SMD for the outcomes of each functional domain, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Defining an I2statistic \u226550 as statistical heterogeneity of the respective meta-analyses, following the same criteria as that of the previous study [10] and the Cochrane Handbook [23], we performed a subgroup analysis when the results of the meta-analysis showed statistical heterogeneity. We performed the subgroup analysis based on stroke chronicity, which was set at 3 months after onset, similar to the criterion in the Cochrane review [1114]. While previous studies have performed subgroup analysis based on the type of robot and the part of the body trained [12], we did not perform further subgroup analysis to ensure the generalizability of the effects of the RAT and to avoid the risk of Type I error elevation due to multiple comparison. To evaluate the risk of publication bias in the results of the respective meta-analyses, we inspected the funnel plots for comparisons using more than 10 studies.

To compare the secondary outcomes, we used the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). An OR greater than 1 indicated that the outcome was more frequently present in the RATS arm. Continuous variables were analyzed using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI, and an SMD >0 corresponded to larger values in the RATS arm. Random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird) were adopted to balance inherent clinical heterogeneity between the included studies. Forest plots were generated to display results.

We used the methods described by Weiet al.to reconstruct IPD from the Kaplan-Meier curves of all eligible studies for the long-term survival outcomes (24). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves, presented as raster and vector images, underwent preprocessing and digitization using an online software called WebPlotDigitizer. This process enabled the extraction of specific time points along with their corresponding survival and mortality data. Whenever supplementary information such as number-at-risk tables or total number of events was accessible, it was utilized to enhance the precision of the time-to-events. In order to identify and rectify deviations from a monotonic pattern, isotonic regression was employed, and any remaining inconsistencies were resolved using a pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (24,25). In order to validate the accuracy of the recorded failure event timings, we conducted a meticulous examination to ensure consistency with the survival or mortality data reported in the original publications. et al. For both OS and DFS calculations, we utilized the Kaplan-Meier method. To assess differences between the groups, we employed the Cox proportional hazards regression model. In this model, it is assumed that every patient within each individual study has a similar likelihood of experiencing failure compared to other patients in that study. To ensure the validity of the Cox models, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the proportional hazards assumption. This involved plotting scaled Schoenfeld residuals, log-log survival plots, and comparing predicted versus observed survival functions. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and we calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% CIs for each group. As a sensitivity analysis, we calculated summary HRs and 95% CIs for all individual studies based on the reconstructed IPD and the results were verified through evaluation of the manuscript and tables of the included studies. Following that the HRs were pooled under and the conventional \u201ctwo-step\u201d meta-analysis for both OS and DFS. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird random-effects model (26). A forest plot for each outcome was used to display the pooled estimates graphically.

Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the p value and I2statistic. If the p value was <0.1 or the I2statistic exceeded 50%, it indicated the presence of statistical heterogeneity. In such cases, efforts are made to identify and address the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or sensitivity analysis. To address the heterogeneity among the included studies, we performed subgroup analyses when examining the differences in HCMV prevalence between individuals with and without T2DM. The studies were divided into two subgroups based on geographical regions: Asia and Europe. To evaluate the influence of individual studies on the observed heterogeneity, we conducted sensitivity analyses. The analysis involved excluding one study at a time and examining the effect of the results on overall heterogeneity. By iteratively removing each study and reassessing the heterogeneity, we were able to determine the extent to which each study contributed to the heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis.

In the duration-effect meta-analysis, we assumed that the relative efficacy of a certain treatment duration (durationi) against another (durationj) can be expressed in the log-OR (log\u2061ORij) and that it is a function of both durations (log\u2061ORij=f(durationi;durationj)). We fitted restricted cubic splines with three knots to the data set obtained by the systematic review because this model has shown sufficient flexibility to capture different shapes.37Given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity likely present in the included studies, we used the random effects model. We used three knots, equally spaced across the duration range (25%, 50% and 75%). Typically, in dose-effect meta-analyses, the reference dose is assigned to the zero or the minimal dose to make interpretation easier.37As this duration-effect meta-analysis aimed to test the non-inferiority of the shorter treatment duration, we decided to use the maximum duration as the reference to make interpretation easier. Also, the reference we set (10-day treatment) can be regarded as the current practice.7 8 27We tested the non-inferiority with the non-inferiority margin of 10%, as previously proposed,28and the superiority of the shorter duration examined against 10-day treatment using the ITT data set. To ascertain the robustness of the primary analyses, we conducted the following sensitivity analyses. To test the stability of the shape of the spline curves, we used different locations of knots (10%, 50% and 90%). To test the influence of trials included, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding trials with an overall high risk of bias and excluding trials with outpatients.

For the meta\u2010analysis of continuous outcome data, random effects estimate of the pooled effect sizes and their confidence intervals were obtained using the inverse variance method for weighting of studies. The heterogeneity of the results from different studies was assessed using commonly used statistics provided in the R\u2010package \u201cmeta\u201d: Cochran's Q, the \u03c42statistic, and the inconsistency factor I2. The I2statistic is defined as the percentage of variability in the effect sizes that is not caused by sampling error. Statistical tests for interstudy heterogeneity were performed with Cochran's Q test. A subgroup analysis for studies of children and athletes was performed to determine whether this demographic characteristic was a significant source of intergroup heterogeneity.

The modified funnel plot and test based on residuals and inverse sample size results in an improved performance for the assessment of publication bias.13In the latter case, one absorbs a significant portion of the interstudy heterogeneity that is not related to publication bias.

As RCTs and NRS are likely to produce different estimates for treatment effects, these models use the first level to estimate variation within individual studies, the second level to estimate variation between studies, and the third level to estimate variation between RCTs and NRS. This allows to disentangle potential sources of between-study heterogeneity that are attributable to differences in study designs by yielding a summary effect for each distinct study design and an overall treatment effect across all study designs. For all our outcomes that were based on RCTs and NRS, three-level mixed effect models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) and confidence intervals based ont-distributions were calculated. To prevent statistical overfitting, the fit of each three-level model was tested against the fit of the respective two-level solution using the Likelihood ratio test. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression test.45Sensitivity analyses were done according to the outlier and influence diagnostics procedure for meta-analyses.46Where analyses were indicative of significant outliers, the leave-one-out method was applied. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the multilevelI2index.47Moderator analyses were carried out by calculating three-level mixed effect models including the interaction term of treatment and the respective moderator variable.

To account for potential confounding between trial design and follow-up duration, additional two-level linear meta-regression models with random effects and REML were calculated to predict effect-size magnitudes as a function of follow-up duration and the interaction between length of follow-up duration and study design (RCT vs. NRS).

Baseline characteristics were compared among weight change patterns in the three intervals using the Rao\u2013Scott\u03c72test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test adjusted for sampling weights for continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to establish odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CKD risk concerning BMI at each time point and weight change patterns in the three intervals. Firstly, we examined the relations between BMI at each time point and CKD risk, using normal weight as the reference group. In our analysis, Model 1 was not adjusted for any covariates. Model 2 accounted for adjustments in covariates such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational level, family income-poverty ratio, smoking status, and physical activity level. Ultimately, Model 3 further refined the adjustments to include potential mediating comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Subsequently, employing a consistent methodology, we meticulously examined the associations between the four weight change patterns across the three intervals and CKD. \u03c7 Subgroup analyses were conducted based on sex (male vs female), age (<60, 60\u201380, and >80 years), and leisure physical activity (0 times/week, 1\u20132 times/week, and \u22653 times/week).

We considered both models that were unadjusted and models adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, family history of ischaemic heart disease, body mass index, and diabetes. These covariates were chosen to be included in the final model, since they are often included in risk assessments.5The effect of age on the association between Heart Age Gap and outcomes was evaluated by studying interaction effects of age by analysing the final model with and without an interaction term for age (Heart Age Gap \u00d7 age). These models were then compared using the likelihood ratio test. In addition to analysing Heart Age Gap as a continuous variable, we performed a Cox regression analysis after categorizing patients within three groups: (i) patients with an A-ECG Heart Age Gap \u22640; (ii) patients with an A-ECG Heart Age Gap between 0 and 10 years, approximating two standard deviations of the Heart Age Gap occurring in healthy volunteers (11.6 years);17and (iii) patients with an A-ECG Heart Age Gap exceeding 10 years.

These analyses were adjusted for covariates (including maternal prenatal psychopathology), which were imputed for missingness using multiple imputation with themicepackage in R.36Logistic regression was performed when offspring hallucinatory experiences (dichotomous) were the outcome. Linear regression was performed in all other association analyses, in which case variables were square root transformed to approximate a normality of the distribution and z-transformed to provide standardized regression estimates. mice Next, mediation analyses were conducted (figure 1). In a single model, we tested the independent mediating effects of offspring childhood adversity and maternal psychopathology, as well as the hypothesized combined (ie, serial/sequential) pathway in which maternal childhood trauma would relate to postnatal psychopathology, which would in turn be associated with offspring childhood adversities, and subsequently relate to offspring psychotic experiences. Analyses were performed using thelavaanstructural equation modeling package in R software.37In one comprehensive serial mediation model, individual regression paths were modeled for the following associations: (1) between exposure (maternal childhood adversity) and outcome (child psychotic experiences, thecpath); (2) between exposure and the 2 mediators (maternal postnatal psychopathology and offspring childhood adversity) as well as between the 2 mediators (ie, theapaths); and (3) between the mediators and the outcome, controlling for exposure (ie, thebpath). The indirect effect was calculated as the product of theaandbpaths and this indirect effect was subtracted from the total effect (ie, thecpath) to calculate the direct effect (ie, thec\u02b9path).

Missing data at each wave of data collection ranged from 0% to 6.59% for main study variables. Full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was used to account for missing data in analyses (Enders, 2010). n t chi To address our first objective, multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to model child internalizing and externalizing behavior trajectories (Singer & Willett, 2003). Growth curves were estimated in Mplus 8 software (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017). The time variable corresponded to child age, in months. Observations at child age 18, 36, and 60\u00a0months were coded as 0, 18, and 42\u00a0months, respectively, to set the starting point of the analysis to zero. First, unconditional growth curves were estimated separately for internalizing and externalizing behavior to identify significant variance in the intercept and slope (Model A). A linear growth model, including fixed and random linear time effects, and a fixed quadratic model were tested. A quadratic slope can be tested with three time points; however, the variance of the quadratic slope needs to be fixed to zero (Hoffman, 2015). Unconditional growth curve models were used to model changes in child behavior overtime, on average, without including confounding factors. Next, potential covariates, including household income, maternal age, marital status, number of siblings, and child sex, were added individually to the model. Covariates that were significant or approached significance (p< .10) and that improved the fit of the model were retained in order to control for variables related to outcomes, while providing a parsimonious representation of findings (Singer & Willett, 2003): Household income (sum of mothers\u2019 and partners\u2019 salaries) and child sex (coded as 1 = male and 0 = female). Externalizing behavior was included as a covariate in the growth model of internalizing behavior, and vice versa, to control for confounding effects. Then, maternal CM was added to the model to examine effects on both intercept (i.e., average level at 18 months) and slope (i.e., rate of change overtime; Model B). Predictors were grand-mean centered (i.e., intercept represents the estimated initial status for an individual with an average value for that predictor). Model fit was assessed by comparing Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) values between models, with lower values indicative of better fit. p To address our second objective, multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether patterns of parenting behavior and maternal depressive symptoms mediated the association between maternal CM and child behavior (Supplemental Figure 1). A 2\u21921\u21921 approach was employed, in which a Level-1 (time-varying) variable mediates the effect of a Level-2 (time-invariant) variable on time-varying outcomes (Krull & MacKinnon, 2001). Estimates of theapathways (i.e., relation between the independent variable and the mediator), thecpathways (i.e., relation between the independent variable and the outcome), and theabindirect pathways must occur at a between-person level, given that the independent variable is constant within an individual. Estimates of thebpathway (i.e., the relation between the mediator and the outcome at level-1) were disaggregated into between- and within-person effects (Krull & MacKinnon, 2001). Between-person effects were assessed using time-averaged measures (i.e., average level across assessment waves) that were grand-mean centered and entered at Level-2, and focused on the effects of CM on child behavior at age 60\u00a0months. Within-person effects (i.e., within-person variations in the predictor across time) were entered as person-mean centered predictors at Level-1. The significance of theabpathway was tested by building 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in RMediation using the distribution of the product method (Tofighi & MacKinnon, 2011). a c ab b ab",

    "14012": "Potential bias due to missing data should be addressed. We assumed that data were missing at random. That is, the missing mechanism depends on the observed data, and multiple imputation was performed to impute incomplete variables (van Ginkel et al., 2020). We created 20 imputed datasets and combined the following effect estimates using Rubin\u2019s rule (Rubin, 1996). First, we compared the respondents\u2019 characteristics between correspondents before multiple imputation (n\u00a0=\u00a024,303\u201324,363) after excluding those with ADL impairments and social support with friends or neighbors versus those with ADL impairments and/or social support with friends or neighbors or missing on it at baseline. Continuous and categorical variables were assessed using t-tests and chi-squared tests, respectively. We additionally present the characteristics of complete cases (i.e., without missing data and/or ADL impairments and/or social support) at baseline. Second, we employed three different Poisson regression models (the total number of types of organizations, each type of social participation, and the frequency of each social participation) to calculate the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of obtaining social support with friends or neighbors after 3 years. Because more than 10% of the subjects fell into the dependent variable of obtaining social support, a generalized linear model with a log link and a Poisson distribution and with robust standard errors was used for multivariate analysis to avoid overestimating the relative risk (Knol et al., 2012). We employed the analysis for the total number of types of organizations each respondent participated in and conducted a trend test and set zero as the reference category, calculatingpfor trend, which indicates that the fostering of social support increases monotonically with the number of social participation. Further, we conducted a linear regression analysis to examine the quantity\u2013response association from multiple perspectives, with the total number of the four types of social support used as the objective variable. In the analysis of each type of groups they participated in and the frequency of each type of social participation, we introduced the eight types of social participation separately, and the reference category was set to \u201cnever.\u201d p Finally, to examine which type of social support was enriched by social participation, we employed a Poisson regression model to calculate RRs and 95% CIs of obtaining receiving/providing emotional social support and receiving/providing instrumental social support.

    "28691": "We described the baseline characteristics of CMEC and UKB participants based on their change in tea consumption status between the baseline and first follow-up surveys. Continuous variables were presented as median (25th, 75th percentile), while categorical variables were presented as count (percentage). In addition, we described the changes in time-varying characteristics between the baseline and first follow-up surveys. To assess the representativeness of the study population, we compared the baseline characteristics of participants who were available for the follow-up with those who were not. To examine the association between change in tea consumption status with the concurrent change in KDM-BA acceleration, we conducted change-to-change analysis using multiple linear regression models, with never drinking as the reference group (Analysis 1). Change-to-change analysis is essentially a self-controlled method using only within-individual information and has been shown to produce valid findings comparable to those obtained from randomized controlled trials by reducing unobserved time-invariant confounding.42,43In the final model, we adjusted for demographics and self-reported disease at baseline, as well as the baseline and concurrent changes of time-variant variables, including age, lifestyle factors and other covariates identified by the DAG mentioned above (Supplementary Methods). To further examine the prospective exposure-response relationship between tea consumption (cups/day and grams/day) and KDM-BA acceleration, we conducted a follow-up adjusted for baseline analysis using multiple linear models among individuals with constant tea consumption status (Analysis 2). The follow-up KDM-BA acceleration was regressed on the baseline tea consumption and adjusted for the baseline KDM-BA acceleration and covariates identified by the DAG mentioned above. Follow-up adjusted for baseline analysis mitigates reverse causation and, to some extent, reduces unmeasured confounding by adjusting for the baseline outcome.44Tea consumption was first fitted in the model as a restricted cubic spline to explore the potential non-linear relationship with KDM-BA acceleration, and then as a categorical variable to better inform dietary-based anti-aging therapy. We divided it into four categories: 0 (never drinking), \u22641 cup/day (low), 2\u20133 cups/day (moderate), and \u22654 cups/day (high), via a comprehensive consideration of the sample size and the magnitude of association in each group. In CMEC, where data on daily tea leaf consumption were available, we replicated the analyses of the exposure-response relationship using the amount of tea leaves consumed. In both of the two main analyses above, to capture the non-linear effects of age on biological aging,45the restricted cubic spline was used to adjust for the baseline age. Missing values of covariates were imputed using multiple imputation (with 5 imputations) by the chained equations method, and the estimates from imputed data sets were combined using Rubin\u2019s rules.46The detailed missing information on covariates was shown inSupplementary Table\u00a0S6. To explore the effect heterogeneity, we performed stratification analysis among predefined subgroups according to their baseline characteristics, including sex, age, BA acceleration, race and ethnicity, urbanicity (CMEC only), TDI (UKB only), smoking status, alcohol consumption and social participation. Social participation was assessed based on the frequency of engaging in social activities or social visits. It was categorized as \u201cless than once a month\u201d (occasional) and \u201cat least once a month\u201d (frequent) in CMEC, while \u201cless than or equal to once a week\u201d (occasional) and \u201cmore than once a week\u201d (frequent) in UKB. To assess the robustness of the findings, we conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the analyses by taking an alternative widely-used definition of KDM-BA acceleration: the residual of KDM-BA regressed on CA using linear regression. Second, we restricted the analyses to relatively healthy populations by excluding individuals with self-reported cancer, CVD, diabetes, and COPD. Third, to evaluate whether our findings were consistent within a traditional longitudinal study framework, we performed survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard models. We dichotomized KDM-BA acceleration (i.e., KDM-BA acceleration > 0, occurrence of accelerated biological aging) and examined the associations between baseline tea consumption and incident accelerated biological aging among individuals with constant tea consumptions status. Participants who had experienced accelerated biological aging at baseline were excluded from this analysis. Fourth, we repeated the analyses using complete case samples (n\u00a0=\u00a07303 for CMEC, n\u00a0=\u00a03960 for UKB) instead of the multiple imputation approach.

First, the difference between HAQ at the last visit and HAQ at the baseline was calculated for each patient. In case the HAQ had not been recorded at the last visit, the penultimate value was considered. The course of the HAQ-DI was then categorized into three groups of clinically meaningful changes in HAQ-DI using the MCID: worsening (\u2a7e+0.22), stable (between \u22120.21 and +0.21) or improvement (\u2a7d\u22120.22). Second, to take into account all visits, a linear mixed model was performed with HAQ-DI dependent on time to evaluate the course of the HAQ-DI over time for the total group, yielding a \u03b2 representing the average change per year. Third, to describe if and how the HAQ-DI scores fluctuated per visit, the change in HAQ-DI compared to the previous visit was calculated for every follow-up visit.

Heat maps were constructed to display this information. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with the overall course of the HAQ-DI. Baseline characteristics between the worsening and improvement groups as described above were compared with logistic regressions adjusted for age, sex and disease duration. In addition, the association with all timepoints of the HAQ-DI was evaluated for the following variables: age above 65\u2009years (above vs lower than 65\u2009years), sex (female vs male), incident case (=duration of symptom other than RP <24\u2009months, yes vs no), autoantibody status (ACA and ATA negative vs ACA and ATA positive), disease subset (non-cutaneous vs limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous) and death/physically unable to come (yes vs no).

    "1403": "Baseline characteristics of the study population by survival status were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality associated with PF (including FEV1, FVC, and PEF). Follow-up time was calculated as the time from study entry until the date of death or the final examination. Laplace regression was used to estimate the 50th percentile difference (PD) and 95% CIs of death for FEV1, FVC, PEF, and composite PF categories separately. In the basic-adjusted model, we adjusted age, sex, and education. In the multiadjusted model, we further adjusted for baseline smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, cognitive function, frailty, BMI, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and depression. Trajectories of PF were ascertained using a backward timescale. That is, year 0 was the year of the last follow-up for the survivors and the year of death for the decedents. A\u00a0linear mixed-effect model was performed to capture the PF trajectory and its difference between survivors and decedents. The fixed effect included PF, follow-up time (year), and their interaction. The random effect included random intercept and slope, allowing individual differences to be reflected at baseline and across follow-up. The difference in PF between survivors and decedents was estimated for each year preceding the year 0.\u00a0The following were considered potential confounders and adjusted for in all analyses: age at year 0, sex, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, cognitive function, frailty, BMI, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and depression.

We conducted multinomial logistic regression analyses to assess differences in patterns for the primary treatment of Stage I NSCLC in patients without diabetes, DM-c and DM\u00a0+\u00a0c while controlling for confounders. We evaluated differences in initial treatment (no treatment, lobectomy, limited resection [wedge resection and segmentectomy], SBRT, and other [chemotherapy and/or standard radiotherapy]) in patients with Stage I NSCLC. In the model, covariates were age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity, income quartile, modified Charlson comorbidity score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer tumor site, tumor location, and year of lung cancer diagnosis. As competing risks of death are a major consideration in patients with diabetes and Stage I NSCLC, we conducted a multivariable Fine-Grey competing risks regression to estimate the impact of diabetes category on the hazards of death from lung cancer and death from other causes. We generated unadjusted cumulative incidence function (CIF) curves for probability of death from lung cancer and probability of death from other causes. Covariates in the Fine-Grey model included risk factors known to impact survival, including age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity, income quartile, modified Charlson comorbidity score category, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and year of lung cancer diagnosis. For lung cancer-specific survival models, analyses also adjusted for lung cancer treatment category, lung cancer tumor site, tumor size, and histology. We conducted competing risk analyses stratified by lung cancer year of diagnosis, treatment type, and comorbidity index score category. Based on the sample size of patients with Stage I NSCLC in SEER-Medicare, we hand >80% power to identify >2% differences in probability of treatment type and we had >80% power to predict a 20% relative difference in conditional probabilities for causes of death that are >15% all observed deaths.

Analyses combined participants across treatment groups to maximize sample size. We included treatment group as a covariate and found no impact on model conclusions. We used RMLCA to identify subgroups of parents with similar patterns of change in HL over time. Each parent was assigned to a specific latent class of participants who shared similar patterns. We estimated the four waves of HL as indicators in a standard latent class model. Model estimation followed a traditional empirical approach, where we started with a 1-class model and increased the number of classes until the best-fitting model was observed. Relative fit indices included the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Consistent Akaike's Information Criterion (CAIC) (lower is better for both). Fit was also assessed using a likelihood ratio test, which compares the k-class model under consideration to a k-1 class, where a significantpvalue indicates that the estimated model fits better than a model with one fewer class (Masyn, 2013;Nylund et al., 2007). We selected the best-fitting model based on the cumulative information provided by model fit indices and the requirement that each class include a minimum of 5% of the sample. p Class membership was examined in association with baseline sociodemographic characteristics using analysis of variance (continuously measured demographics) and Fisher's exact tests (categorically measured demographics that included some small cell sizes) and with oral health variables (knowledge, beliefs, behavior, DMFS) using regression. In regression models, 36-month oral health variables were regressed on dummy-coded indicators of class membership, adjusting for age, education, income, and treatment group. Models appropriately addressed the response distribution for each oral health variable, with linear regression used for most variables and a negative binomial distribution for DMFS, which is highly skewed with overdispersion. All modeling was performed most likely using class membership with participants assigned to the class most reflective of their HL trajectory. Although this \u201cclassify/analyze\u201d approach has better interpretability because it is easily applied using standard regression methods, it does not address classification uncertainty (Clark & Muth\u00e9n, 2009). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm model conclusions using a weighting procedure (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2014) to account for classification uncertainty. As model conclusions were unchanged, the simpler approach was retained for interpretability.",

Frequency/percentage and mean/standard deviation (SD) were utilized to characterize categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Then, to further analyze the impact of chronic diseases on health care costs of the older adults, we referred to studies on the impact of smoking37or obesity38on health care costs and developed the following 2-part random effects model to evaluate the impact of chronic diseases on health care utilization and cost in older adults.

Since the dependent variables of equation (1) are dummy variables of 3 classifications (whether outpatient service is utilized, whether hospitalization is utilized and whether health care is utilized), equation (1) is estimated using random effects Logit model, whereas equation (2) is estimated using random effects generalized least squares model. We used the parameters in equations (1) and (2) to predict health care costs in both the presence and absence of chronic disease scenarios. Referring to the existing studies38,39first, the estimated parameters were utilized to predict the annual per capita health care cost of the older adults based on the actual situation, as an actual value (Y^iA). Then, we predict the health care cost of the older adults without the chronic disease as a counterfactual value (Y^iCF) by setting the parameter of the chronic disease to 0 (assuming that the older adults do not have the chronic disease) and maintaining all other characteristics. The chronic disease attributable fraction (CDAF) can be calculated based on the predicted actual value and the counterfactual value using equation (3). CDAF=Y^iA\u2212Y^iCFY^iA(3) It should be further noted that the equations can be used to predict the costs attributable to a specific chronic disease using the estimated coefficients for only one chronic disease, or they can be combined with the estimated coefficients for all chronic diseases to predict the total costs attributable to the 6 chronic diseases. Additionally, we performed a robustness analysis. To better control for unobservable factors that do not vary over time but may influence individual health care costs, we selected participants who were surveyed in all 3 waves from the available sample to create a balanced panel data. And, based on this, we conducted equations (1) and (2) to obtain the estimation results (SeeSupplemental Tables). After comparing the 2 estimates, we found that there is no significant change in the main findings despite a slight change in magnitude. The effect of chronic conditions on health care utilization and health care costs, as well as the cost fraction attributable to chronic conditions, have not changed significantly. Comparison of the robustness analysis results and main results further demonstrates the robustness of the estimation. Thep-value\u2009<\u2009.1 could be identified as statistical significance.

    "20179": "First, to investigate the association between different types of PA and the risk of CKD incidence, we conducted analyses in the questionnaire-based cohort. In the questionnaire-based cohort, baseline characteristics by incident CKD or not were reported as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. We investigated the associations of 21 questionnaire-based PA terms with the risk of CKD incidence using Cox proportional hazard regression models, with time at recruitment as the start of follow-up. The Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, recruitment centre, Townsend deprivation index, education level, diet ideal or poor, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI category, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of CVD, PRS of CKD, genetic ethnic group, and first 10 principal components of ancestry. Second, to accurately elucidate the association between PA and the risk of CKD incidence and further enhance the strength of evidence regarding PA, we conducted analyses in the accelerometer-based cohort. In the accelerometer-based cohort, baseline characteristics by quartile of total PA in MET were reported as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Using Cox proportional hazard regression models, with the time accelerometer wearing finished as the start of follow-up, we investigated the associations of genetic risk categories, PA categories (LPA, MPA, VPA, total PA, and MVPA), and their combination with the risk of CKD incidence. Cox models were adjusted as in questionnaire-based analysis and additionally for the season of accelerometer wear. Moreover, we included an interaction term involving PA categories and genetic risk categories in the Cox models. Subsequently, a likelihood ratio test was performed to assess the statistical significance of this interaction. In addition, we assessed the shape of the relationship between PA categories and the risk of CKD incidence using a restricted cubic spline model. To minimize the influence of outliers on the model, we trimmed observations below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile based on the distribution of the PA data (total PA, MVPA, LPA, MPA, and VPA) from the lowest to the highest. Additionally, we specified the knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th centiles, which were utilized for categorizing the LPA, MPA, VPA, total PA, and MVPA. Furthermore, we also performed several subgroup analyses to assess the robustness of our findings and explore potential variations. These analyses were stratified by PRS (Low, Intermediate, High), age (<65/\u2265 65 years), sex (Female/Male), BMI (<30/\u2265 30\u00a0kg/m2), diabetes (Yes/No), hypertension (Yes/No), and CVD (Yes/No). To enhance the comprehensibility of our results while avoiding redundancy, we placed the results of the LPA in theSupplemental Materials. Additionally, we performed several sensitivity analyses to ensure the reliability and robustness of our findings. First, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients for all types of PAs, and we put LPA, MPA, and VPA into one model to mutually adjust for each other. Second, we conducted the main analyses exclusively among participants with complete covariate data to minimize potential biases due to missing information. Third, we excluded events that occurred within two years after accelerometer wearing to address any concerns regarding reverse causality. Fourth, we carried out the main analyses among participants without diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to avoid the potential impact of these comorbidities on the association between PA and CKD risk. Fifth, considering death as a competing risk for CKD incidence, we employed the Fine\u2013Gray sub-distribution hazards using the competing risk model to examine any potential bias from competing risks. To address any missing covariate values in the questionnaire-based and accelerometer-based analysis, we employed multiple imputations utilizing the \u201cmice\u201d R package,32ensuring the statistical power and minimizing inferential bias.Supplementary Tables\u00a0S6 and\u00a0S7provide detailed information on missing covariates of participants in the questionnaire-based and accelerometer-based analysis.

We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to quantify the associations. To account for multiple tests, we corrected P values using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) via the Benjamin-Hochberg method.34 This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Since little is known about the potential differences between BD\u2010I and BD\u2010II in OABD, we employed an agnostic (hypothesis\u2010free) approach. A two\u2010sided alpha of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Missing data were handled with pairwise deletion (available case analysis) and for the GLMMs with listwise deletion (complete case analysis). Non\u2010parametric tests (Mann\u2013Whitney U test or Fisher exact test) were performed to compare sociodemographic and clinical factors between BD\u2010I and BD\u2010II. We also accounted for systematic differences between the contributing studies by performing generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial probability distribution with a logit link function. In these models a sociodemographic or clinical factor was entered as a predictor, BD subtype as the outcome variable, and study cohort as a random intercept. We performed GLMMs with BD subtype as predictor and study cohort as random intercept. The residuals of both continuous outcomes (i.e., GAF and cognitive g\u2010score) were normally distributed within each of the 15 contributing studies. For these outcomes, we used a GLMM with a normal probability distribution with an identity link function. For the outcome somatic burden, a GLMM with a Poisson probability distribution with a log link function was employed, as is appropriate for count data. For each outcome, crude analyses (only controlling for study cohort) and analyses adjusted for age, education level, and gender were performed. For evaluation of missing data, binary missing data indicators (MDIs) were created for GAF, cognitive g\u2010score, and somatic burden, with 1\u00a0=\u00a0missing and 0\u00a0=\u00a0present. The association between BD subtype and missing data was evaluated with GLMMs with a binomial distribution and a logit link function, with BD subtype as predictor, MDI as outcome and study cohort as a random intercept. We initially planned to adjust the GLMM analyses for eight potential confounders: age, gender, education level, number of affective episodes, late onset, depression severity, history of psychiatric hospitalizations, and anti\u2010psychotics use. However, many cohorts had substantial amounts of missing data on these variables. Therefore, we repeated the analyses in a subset of participants with complete data on these eight confounders to examine how likely it is that these confounders would substantially affect the estimated differences in outcomes between BD\u2010I and BD\u2010II.",

The responders were then divided into two groups based on their reported knowledge of the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Reported lifestyle choices, including healthcare visits, diet, exercise, medication and smoking status, in the year(s) since the affected pregnancy were compared between participants who were aware of the risks and those who were not.

    "15409": "For each emulated trial (not vaccinated, one or two doses of vaccine, booster dose, primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reinfection), baseline characteristics before and after weighting were presented. We used absolute standardized differences to evaluate the balance of baseline characteristics between groups, and a value <0.1 was considered evidence of good balance. We also examined the association between a set of prespecified sociodemographic, health, health behavior, and temporal characteristics, and the odds of receiving a prescription for nirmatrelvir with multivariate logistic regression. Our aim was to examine the effect of starting nirmatrelvir in populations with the same baseline characteristics as the overall nirmatrelvir population but with a different vaccination status and reinfection status. Within each population group that met the criteria for one of the five specified trials (not vaccinated, one or two doses of vaccinate, booster dose, primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reinfection), we generated a propensity score from logistic regression for the probability of belonging to the overall nirmatrelvir population. The propensity score was then used to construct the inverse probability weight and applied to each trial population, which resulted in each trial population having similar baseline characteristics compared with the overall population that received nirmatrelvir. Within each weighted population group, we then applied the clone method to estimate the effect of starting nirmatrelvir within five days of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result, considering the time difference between infection and the start of treatment.10303132The clone method was performed in three steps: cloning, censoring, and weighting (fig 2). First, we assigned each participant to both treatment strategies (nirmatrelvir or no treatment), so that at T0each participant was cloned, and one copy of the observation (clone) was assigned to the nirmatrelvir group and one copy to the no treatment group. Second, we conducted censoring to ensure that participants followed their assigned strategy after T0. Because the no treatment group had a strategy of not receiving any covid-19 treatment during the treatment initiation period, the copies (or clones) in the no treatment group were censored on the day they received nirmatrelvir or other outpatient covid-19 treatments within the first five days of T0. Similarly, the copies in the nirmatrelvir group were censored on the day they received other outpatient covid-19 treatments before receiving nirmatrelvir or at the end of the treatment initiation period (five days after T0) for those who had not received treatment by that time. Clone process Third, we applied weighting to deal with the selection bias introduced by censoring; this approach constructs a hypothetical population in which the occurrence of the censoring would be random. Within each cloned group and on each day during the first five day treatment initiation period, logistic regression was built to predict the probability of not being censored within those remaining in the group in the previous day. The inverse of this probability was then stabilized by the observed proportion of those remaining in the group and served as the weight on that day. Cumulative weighting was constructed by multiplying the weight from T0(T0was the date of the positive test result and day 1 of the treatment initiation period) up to that day and was then used as the final weight for that day.3233Across the five emulated trials, the inverse probability of censoring weights had a mean ranging from 0.98 to 1.12 and standard deviation ranging from 0.01 to 0.15 (table S2), resulting in covariates that were well balanced between the groups. As a result, truncation of the weights was not undertaken. The final weight at day 5 (the end of the treatment initiation period) was used as the weight for subsequent days. The effect was estimated by a weighted non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator.34Cumulative incidence at 30 days and differences between groups were estimated and reported as a percentage at 30 days. Effectiveness on a relative scale, reported as relative risk, was estimated as the cumulative incidence in the nirmatrelvir arm compared with the no treatment arm. We also repeated all of the analyses in the five emulated trials with an alternative approach of constructing the initial inverse probability weighting toward participants who received nirmatrelvir within the emulated trial population, instead of our primary approach of weighting toward all participants who received nirmatrelvir. For example, in the primary analyses, the effect of nirmatrelvir in the unvaccinated trial was estimated as an average treatment effect of those who were not vaccinated but with the same other baseline characteristics as those who received nirmatrelvir in the overall cohort across vaccination status. In this alternative approach, the effect of nirmatrelvir in the unvaccinated trial was estimated as an average treatment effect of those who had the same baseline characteristics as participants who received nirmatrelvir and were not vaccinated. The purpose of these analyses was to provide an estimate of effectiveness within the population that received the treatment in the real world and take into account the influence of baseline factors associated with the emulated trial population (eg, participants who received a booster vaccine were generally older and might have had a higher burden of comorbid conditions than those who were not vaccinated). We further emulated several more trials to examine the effect of nirmatrelvir in populations with different characteristics, including age (\u226465 years and >65 years), sex (men and women), race (white and black), number of risk factors for progression to severe covid-19 illness (1-2, 3-4, and \u22655 risk factors), and period of infection (BA.1 or BA.2 predominant era between 3 January and 25 June 2022, and BA.5 predominant era between 26 June and 5 November 2023).35All populations were weighted toward all participants who received nirmatrelvir (as described for the primary analyses). We then examined if these characteristics modified the association between nirmatrelvir and admission to hospital or death by comparison of relative risks between populations. We conducted multiple sensitivity analyses for each of the five emulated trials to examine the robustness of the findings. First, to remove the influence of events that occurred shortly after the SARS-CoV-2 positive test result, we examined the effect in those who did not have an event within the five day treatment initiation period (compared with the primary approach which allowed people who had an event in the five day treatment initiation period to be included and censored at the time the event occurred). Second, to test the alternative treatment strategy of starting treatment within the first three days of a positive test result, we examined the effect when defining the start of the treatment period as three days, compared with the five day treatment initiation strategy used in the primary approach. Third, to examine the sensitivity of the study results to our primary imputation method, we used a multiple imputation approach with 10 imputations, compared with single imputation used in the primary approach. Fourth, to further examine the influence of imputation, we conducted analyses only in cohort participants with complete data. Fifth, because some participants might cluster within the same healthcare system and share the same healthcare system level characteristics, we constructed a propensity score based on an hierarchical model where participants were specified as clustered within a healthcare system, compared with a one level model in the primary approach.36Sixth, as an alternative analytic methodology to the approach based on propensity score used in the primary analyses, we used the instrumental variable method, where the number of nirmatrelvir prescriptions for each SARS-CoV-2 positive test result in the hospital within seven days of a participant testing positive was set as an instrumental variable, and we then performed two stage residual inclusion analyses.37383940 We used the approach outlined by Lipsitch et al to specify and test the association between nirmatrelvir and negative outcome controls where no previous knowledge supports a causal association.41Admission to hospital or death within three days of the start of treatment was selected as the negative outcome control.9The application of negative outcome controls might reduce (but does not eliminate) concerns about possible biases, including cohort design, covariate selection, determining outcome, and other sources of latent biases. As a positive control, we excluded participants with a history of any covid-19 vaccination or history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those admitted to hospital in the first two days, and examined the risk over 28 days of follow-up.42The purpose of this analysis was to test whether our approach would reproduce the protective association between nirmatrelvir and the risk of admission to hospital or death that was seen in the EPIC-HR (Study of Oral PF-07321332/Ritonavir Compared With Placebo in Nonhospitalized High Risk Adults With covid-19) trial.2 In all analyses, confidence intervals were generated based on non-parametric bootstrap with 500 replicates. Risk on the relative scale with 95% confidence interval that did not cross one and risk on the absolute scale with 95% confidence interval that did not cross zero was considered significant. We used SAS Enterprise Guide, version 8.2 (SAS Institute), to perform the analyses.",

The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for AUCs were estimated using the Delong method.73Corresponding 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios, adjusted odds ratios, specificity, sensitivity and the difference measurements were calculated using 1,000 bootstrap samples. Age, gender, BMI, and smoking status were included as covariates in the adjusted odds ratio. Throughout the statistical analysis, we adhered to the PCS (Predictability, Computability and Stability) framework for veridical (trustworthy) data science,35which has proven valuable in many previous scientific discoveries including novel gene-gene interaction for the red-hair phenotype,74clinically-relevant subgroups in a randomized drug trial,75and interpretable drug response prediction.76For the modeling stage as in this paper, the PCS framework uses predictability as a reality check, and for reproducibility, it advocates for a stability analysis across different reasonable perturbations of the data and models that pass the prediction check. Under this framework, the entire PLCO specimen set was divided into (1) a Development Set that was used for training and tuning the models (Training Set) and model selection (Validation Set) and (2) a set-aside Test Set for obtaining an unbiased evaluation of the selected final model (Figure\u00a02;Table\u00a0S1). The Development Set consisted of case and non-case sera from seven of the ten PLCO study centers; the set-aside Test Set consisted of case and non-case sera from the remaining three PLCO study centers. Seven different learning algorithms were evaluated including a deep learning model (fully-connected feedforward network), gradient boosting machine, auto-machine learning, iterative random forest, logistic regression with LASSO (L1) regularization, logistic regression with ridge (L2) regularization, and logistic regression models. Deep neural network, extreme gradient boosting, and auto machine learning algorithms were performed using the h2o package in R.77Iterative random forest was run using the iRF package in R.78To further evaluate model stability in accordance with PCS framework, data perturbations (e.g., via random selection and replacement) were introduced to the Development Set and the performance re-assessed. Based on AUC, a LASSO regression model with 3 selected microbial-associate metabolites (an indole-derivative, TMAO, and indoleacrylic acid) that showed the highest and most stable predictive performance was selected for subsequent testing in the set-aside Test Set as well as the independent newly diagnosed PDAC cohort. To select the non-microbiome metabolites, the adjusted odds ratio and corresponding p value for each feature were calculated and corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg in the training set in which 12 metabolites showed an adjusted odds ratio greater than 1 with adjusted p value less than 0.05. Five out of 12 features yielded significant p values and adjusted odds ratio greater than 1 in the Validation Set. The prediction performance of the combined five non-microbiome features trained in the training set using logistic regression was evaluated against the microbiome metabolite panel and CA19-9 in the testing set. For the combination of 3-marker microbial-related metabolite panel, non-microbiome metabolite panel and CA19-9, we fit a logistic regression with three separate predictors, one corresponding to each of the aforementioned features. This model was developed in the Development Set and validated in the set-aside Test Set.

The offset term is the logit of the prevalence in the population minus the logit of the prevalence in the analyzed dataset.

Accession was defined as the date of blood sample receipt for MSK-IMPACT testing, corresponding to the approximate time a patient consented to testing. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression estimated associations between select somatic mutations and the risk for developing an ATE event. Death was treated as a competing risk, and for the cause-specific model, patients were censored at the time of death. The analysis included the 25 most commonly altered genes in addition toCDKN2B, which was included because of prior knowledge of an association with the risk for venous thromboembolism.20A separate model was built for each mutation; all models were adjusted for cytotoxic chemotherapy in the year prior to accession, age, and presence of metastatic disease as assessed at accession. Additionally, all models were stratified on the basis of tumor type, and because some tumor samples were previously banked, the years from the procedure to accession: [0], (0-0.25], (0.25-1], (1-5], and (5,+]. Left truncation was used for the subset of procedures that occurred after accession but before the end of the 1-year period. Estimated HRs are reported along with their 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed for all models by visualizing, for each factor, the scaled Schoenfeld residuals over time, along with a score test evaluating a time-varying interaction.25The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjustPvalues for false discovery. For identified mutations, the associations were also evaluated using the subdistribution Fine and Gray approach as an alternative measure, and cumulative incidence function estimated the incidence of ATE; both analyses treated death as a competing risk.

All models interacted ACEs and race to estimate subgroup-specific associations. Because our aim was to understand if associations are stronger for Multiracial people, we specified Multiracial participants as the reference group in all interactions. We also conducted sensitivity analyses with Whites as the referent group to compare findings with previous studies which have used this approach. We used complex survey weights corresponding to a cross-sectional multi-wave analysis to produce nationally representative estimates using the \u201csurvey\u201d package in R.71,72Because 55% of observations were missing data on an ACE component, 21% on a covariate, and 40% on an outcome (frequencies presented inAppendix C), we used multiple imputation including all outcomes in imputations models, and pooled results across 20 imputed datasets.73We imputed data using the \u201cmi\u201d and \u201cmitools\u201d packages in R.74,75We summed and dichotomized ACE scores in regression analyses after imputation of missing ACE component variables. We assessed interactions on the relative scale by estimating subgroup specific risk ratios (RRs), and on the absolute scale by estimating the interaction contrast, scaled up to reflect excess cases per 1,000 (formula and details inAppendix D).76We assessed statistical differences between group RRs using p-values with pre-specified \u03b1 = 0.05 from global Wald tests for significance of interaction terms.

Student's t\u2010test and the Chi\u2010square test were used as appropriate to compare differences in baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models for both outcomes were adjusted for the following variables known to impact mortality in HFrEF: age, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, NYHA class, ischaemic heart disease, history of diabetes, history of bypass surgery, history of percutaneous coronary intervention, history of implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD), history of pacemaker, history of stroke, history of peripheral arterial disease, history of atrial fibrillation, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of cancer, EF, QRS duration, haemoglobin, creatinine, sodium, beta\u2010blocker use, ACE/ARB use, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use, loop diuretic use, thiazide diuretic use and allopurinol use.

    "36802": "Since cytokines showed highly skewed distributions and extreme values, we performed an inverse normal transformation and standardisation of cytokines levels to avoid further complications within the primary analyses that may bias model estimates (seeonline supplemental figures 1 and 2).     The missing values in cytokine data usually derive from concentrations below the platform detection level or for technical reasons. However, as the cytokine panel evaluated also displayed a highly correlated internal structure with detectable clusters of cytokines, missingness in a given cytokine can be explained by the observed values in other cytokines and therefore, not dependent on the missing values themselves. Consequently, missing values can be deemed \u2018missing-at-random\u2019 in a sense proposed by Little and Rubin,15which allowed the development of multiple imputation procedures to overcome potential biases related to this missingness in later analyses.16 Accordingly, 100 multiple imputed datasets were obtained utilising the Amelia-II package17in R statistical software (V. 3.6.3),18which implements an expectation-maximisation with bootstrapping algorithm. This multiple imputed process was done through an imputation model that included all other cytokines together with sex, age at the study intake, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, smoking at the baseline examination and self-reported alcohol drinking at the baseline examination (1997 cohort only), to help in the prediction. All subsequent statistical tests used the multiple imputed data, following the recommendations by Lynn and Rubin16to compute pooled test estimates. Subsequently, each multiple imputed cytokine was entered as a predictor of incident AF within Cox proportional hazards models within two steps. In the first step, the model (model 1) also included age and sex. In a second step, the model (model 2) also included age and sex, plus BMI, smoking at the study intake, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and the time-dependent incident myocardial infarction and incident heart failure. Due to these analyses\u2019 complexity, we set a p value threshold for statistical significance both cohort-wise and for the meta-analysis that considered the family-wise error rate (Bonferroni method) and the expectedly high intrinsic correlation of the cytokine data. This procedure was done by dividing the traditional alpha level of significance (0.05) by the maximum number of independent tests, which was determined itself as the product of the minimum number of orthogonal linear (principal) components explaining >95% of the observed variance in the multiple imputed cytokine panel. Accordingly, there were 14 independent tests for FINRISK 1997 data and 37 independent tests for FINRISK 2002 data (seeonline supplemental figure 3), thus setting the Bonferroni corrected p value threshold for statistical significance at p\u22640.00357 for the 1997 cohort and p\u22640.00135 in the 2002 cohort. For the meta-analysis of the 20 overlapping cytokines, we assumed 20 independent tests, thus setting this threshold at p\u22640.00250.",

The cumulative incidence of a FIB-4 index >3.25 was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between subgroups using the log-rank test. Bayesian proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between the development of a FIB-4 >3.25 during follow-up (binary, time-dependent) and clinical disease progression. Two models were fitted to this end, one only including the time-varying FIB-4 score, and one that additionally included baseline variables. The Bayesian framework allowed us to simultaneously estimate model parameters and impute missing covariate values.21Where the baseline values of albumin, total bilirubin and creatinine were missing, their value was imputed based on all available measurements \u00b12 years before/after the index date. Patients were censored when they started treatment leading to SVR, or at the time of the last available FIB-4 measurement. To assess the association between baseline characteristics and time to a FIB-4 index >3.25, another Bayesian multivariable proportional hazards model was fitted. We performed several sensitivity analyses for this model, applying more stringent criteria for inclusion and event definition. Details can be found in theonline supplemental materials. To investigate the pattern of liver disease development, we fitted a Bayesian linear mixed model to the natural logarithm-transformed repeated measurements of FIB-4 for those patients who, at some point, had FIB-4 >3.25. Time was modelled using a natural cubic spline with 4 df to allow for a flexible non-linear shape of the subject-specific trajectories. Due to the lack of a common baseline time, we used a reverse time approach with the last FIB-4 measurement as time=0. For visualisation, we plot the expected FIB-4 over time with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CIs). Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of a FIB-4 >3.25 from HCV infection onwards for the subset of patients for which an estimated year of infection was available.

The frequency of these outcomes was compared using a \u03c72test between the chronic hypertension and no hypertension groups and between the treated hypertension and untreated hypertension groups. The distribution of different gestational ages at birth was described by curves according to the existence of chronic hypertension and the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. We performed univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models to estimate the incidence risk ratios (IRRs) of maternal and infant outcomes according to chronic hypertension versus no hypertension, treated hypertension versus no hypertension, and untreated hypertension versus no hypertension, with a 95% CI. Multivariate Poisson models were performed corrected for overdispersion and adjusted for maternal age (years), social deprivation, obesity, tobacco use, history of diabetes, multiple pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Models estimating the IRRs of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia were adjusted on these covariates except for gestational diabetes. As a sensibility analysis, we computed a propensity score of being treated during pregnancy for women with chronic hypertension before pregnancy based on a logistic regression model. All previously cited covariates were included in the propensity score plus the year of childbirth. We then estimated the odds ratios of maternal and infant outcomes using logistic regression models (crude and weighted on the inverse probability of treatment). The purpose of this sensibility analysis was to assess whether the associations between mother and child outcomes and antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy persist when a propensity score instead of a multiple adjustment controls the indication bias.

Random forest was chosen as the classification algorithm.25,26Initially, each patient was randomly assigned to either the training (70%), validation (15%), or test dataset (15%) while ensuring an equal distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors between the datasets. The dataset suffered from class imbalance, a common problem when utilizing random forest for classification purposes.27Therefore, we utilized the random forest quantile classifier during model training and hyperparameter tuning on the training set.28Hyperparameter optimization was explored in a stepwise fashion through narrowing grid searches for each model level until no further improvement could be achieved based on out-of-bag Brier score. Hyperparameter-optimization was performed on number of trees, tree depth, node size, and number of variables available to choose from at each split. Final testing for each model was done on the assigned test set with no weighing or sampling of survivors/nonsurvivors. The validation set was set aside as a secondary dataset on which to retest the model in the case that the results from testing on the test set showed the need for further model alterations. A cutoff point was selected for each model using the Youden index, and discriminative model performance was measured by ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) curves, AUROCs (area under receiver-operating characteristic) curves, Brier scores, sensitivity, and specificity on the test set. To gain insight into the model\u2019s decision-making process, we utilized variable importance and partial dependence plots. Variables were selected based on availability at discharge through electronic health records and expected correlation with mortality, as suggested by previous studies.13\u201316To investigate how model performance changed with additional information, variables were gradually added groupwise in an estimated order of most to least easily available to the physician. The order in which variables were added was: level 0 (age, sex), level 1 (level 0 + discharge diagnosis, specialty), level 2 (level 1 + time of day at discharge, day of the week at time of discharge, length of stay), level 3 (level 2 + laboratory results from the index hospitalization, previous hospitalization during the last 30 days prior to index hospitalization), level 4 (level 3 + diseases of Charlson Comorbidity Index, number of different prescription drugs redeemed within 6 months prior to the index hospitalization), and level 5 (level 4 + living situation, marital status, education, yearly disposable income). Finally, we developed a one-step backward-selection model using only variables from the level 5 model with positive importance.",

Binary cessation outcomes were analyzed two ways: (1) coding missing\u00a0data as returned to smoking (labeled as Missing\u00a0=\u00a0Smoking; M\u00a0=\u00a0S) as per suggested practice25and (2) utilizing generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with binary distribution, logit links, and random residual options to allow time points with missing data to be informed by prior collected data. No imputations were made for continuous outcomes. For M\u00a0=\u00a0S analyses, logistic regression models were used for each of the cessation outcomes noted above, with the main effect of intervention group included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined from the models for (1) point prevalence abstinence at weekly follow-up, (2) floating abstinence, (3) cumulative incidence of 24 hr QA's and (4) achieving 50% reduction in CPD. The GLMMs were created similarly with main effects for intervention group, time, and an interaction between time and group. Estimate statements from the models were used to determine group differences at each time point of interest and reported as ORs and 95% CIs. Note that both M\u00a0=\u00a0S and GLMM outcomes are shown inTable\u00a02, but the text within Results reports M\u00a0=\u00a0S outcomes (outcome percents, ORs, 95% CIs) only. Per the original protocol (Supplemental Materials), covariates were not included in models unless baseline differences suggested need for otherwise. General linear models (GLMs) were used to measure the relationships between group and time for continuous outcomes of interest such as CPD, MTQ, CTQ, and dependence. Interactions between time and group were initially included in models and were removed if not significant at an \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.1 level of significance, leaving the main effects of time and group. Patterns of use and dual use over time are also largely descriptive, and in cases of missing data, the last observation was carried forward. As noted above, the current trial stands in contrast with many existing RCTs, in that study recruitment was open to smokers across the motivational spectrum, without requirement to quit. Accordingly, many of the above outcomes were separately assessed among smokers high (7\u201310 on 10-pt scale) and low in motivation to quit (0\u20136), to determine if the effects were restricted to merely the former. Notably, the trial was not powered on these post-hoc sub-group differences; the intent herein is to compare effect sizes only.",

They included age, female sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, atrial fibrillation, chronic lung disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3\u20134, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, EuroScore II, TAD, and concomitant operative procedures. Weights for patients with E2E were the inverse of the PS, and those for patients without E2E were the inverse of 1-PS. Stabilized weights were used to reduce variability in the IPTW model.15)The density plots before and after IPTW were included inSupplementary Figure 2. We also analyzed PS matching as an added robust analysis result. With this method, a total of 83 patients who underwent E2E were matched 1:1 with patients who underwent TVR using the PSs using nearest-neighbor matching without replacement and a matching tolerance (caliper) of 0.25 (Supplementary Table 1). Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival rates were compared between the 2 groups and subgroups using the log-rank test.

Medication adherence was set as the dependent variable. The independent variable sex was assigned as \u201cmale =0\u201d, \u201cfemale =1\u201d; family history was assigned as \u201cno =0\u201d, \u201cyes =1\u201d; medication side effects was assigned as \u201cno =0\u201d, \u201cyes =1\u201d; the dummy variable of type of antipsychotics was assigned as first generation antipsychotics+second generation antipsychotics (FGA+SGA): \u201cSGA=0\u201d, \u201cFGA+SGA=1\u201d, \u201cSGA+SGA=0\u201d and second generation antipsychotics+second generation antipsychotics (SGA+SGA): \u201cSGA=0\u201d, \u201cFGA+SGA=0\u201d, \u201cSGA+SGA=1\u201d; tobacco smoking was assigned as \u201cno =0\u201d, \u201cyes =1\u201d; occupation was assigned as blue-collar work: \u201cunemployed=0\u201d, \u201cblue-collar work=1\u201d, \u201cwhite-collar work=0\u201d and white-collar work: \u201cunemployed=0\u201d, \u201cblue-collar work=0\u201d, \u201cwhite-collar work=1\u201d. The results of collinearity diagnostics showed that the variance inflation factor (VIF) for all independent variables was between 1 and 2. As the multiple linear regression analysis indicated a significant correlation between executive function and medication adherence, the mediating role of executive function was explored further. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyse the relationships between level of education, executive function and medication adherence. These two steps were performed using SPSS.32 A bootstrapping approach with the PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to analyse the mediating effect of executive function on level of education and medication adherence in individuals with schizophrenia.33A bootstrap sampling procedure was used to determine the significance of indirect effects.34The bootstrapping procedure used generated 5000 samplings from the original data set (N = 329) by random sampling that made it possible to obtain 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (BcCI), which indicate the existence of a significant indirect effect in the case of not containing the zero.

Because of the pragmatic design, a high primary drop-out rate of approximately 50 per cent was anticipated. Confounding may have occurred because the patients were not assigned randomly to the groups. To determine which variables were relevant confounders, a causal directed acyclic graph was created (Fig. S1). This type of graph shows the causal influences of different variables on each other. Using this graph and Pearl\u2019s backdoor criterion22, the relevant confounders for assessing the causal effect of CME or MA on survival were determined. The adjustment set consisted of BMI, age, centre, T category, tumour location, ASA fitness grade, and operative approach. Fig. S1 To investigate the effect of CME on survival as a first step, a simple Cox regression analysis was performed without adjustment. Another Cox regression analysis was then carried out in which all relevant confounders were included: Cox regression with multiple imputations for missing values, inverse probability treatment weighing, and generalized boosted models23,24(Figs S2 and S3). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were calculated for each treatment group. Survival probabilities were obtained using the multivariate Cox regression models to perform direct standardization. The corresponding confidence intervals were obtained using a normal approximation, where the asymptotic variance was estimated using the influence function25. Figs S2 and S3 To analyse the influence of MA on survival, the same regression models and sensitivity analyses were used (Table S1).

In the first stage, we calculated station-specific associations between air pollutants and cause-specific mortality using Poisson regression models allowing for overdispersion. We adjusted for the following confounders: time trend, day of the week, vacation periods, public holidays, air temperature, and relative humidity. Effects of high and low temperatures were added separately to the model according to Stafoggia and colleagues (2013) (16). We used cubic regression splines for time trends (four degrees of freedom per year) and meteorological parameters (three degrees of freedom) to account for nonlinear confounding. We analyzed associations between air pollutants and mortality using different aggregated lags. Specifically, we assessed immediate (0\u20131 d after exposure [lag0\u20131]), delayed (2\u20134 d and 5\u20137 d after exposure [lag2\u20134 and lag5 \u20137, respectively]) and overall effects (lag0\u20137). In the second stage, station-specific estimates were pooled using a novel multilevel meta-analysis that accounts for hierarchical structures, including random terms for cities and stations (17). We tested for heterogeneity between the station-specific estimates and obtained the correspondingPvalue andI2statistic. All results are presented as a percent change per interquartile range increase in the respective air pollutant concentration to compare the relative health effects across pollutants.

Treatment outcomes of initial rootcanal therapy were measured at the tooth level. For tooth-level analysis, patients were excluded if they had less than 1 year of insurance enrollment after treatment or records of treatment were missing the associated tooth number. To ensure external validity, \u03c72tests andttests were used to compare characteristics between those excluded due to missing tooth number and those included in the sample. t Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the association between payer-type and initial root canal therapy at the person level, with adjustments for age, sex, tooth type (anterior, premolar, molar), and provider type. For the evaluation of procedural outcomes at the tooth level, initial root canal therapies were considered successful unless there was an adverse event (tooth extraction, endodontic retreatment, apicoectomy) or they were censored at an identified lapse in the patient\u2019s insurance enrollment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate procedural survival according to payer type. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the hazard of adverse event occurrence after initial root canal therapy, according to payer type (public or private), using a model that adjusted for the following covariates: age, sex, tooth type, and provider type. Member identification was also included in this model to account for person-level clustering and to generate estimates with robust SEs. In addition, this methodology was used to assess procedural survival according to provider type in a subset of the sample limited to procedures completed by an individual provider, with the adjusted Cox proportional hazard model controlling for age, sex, tooth type, and payer type. The payment data (amounts allowed and paid via the insurer) for initial root canal therapy were summarized according to both payer and tooth type. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test for the statistical significance of differences in paid and allowed amounts according to payer type for each tooth type (that is, anterior, premolar, and molar).

The nomogram was constructed as follows: First, we conducted univariable analyses with principal endpoints of the CSS at 3, 5, and 8\u00a0years. Second, factors clearly linked to survival in each univariate analysis (P< .05) were integrated into the multivariable Cox regression analysis. A final multivariable model was derived through inverse model selection. A nomogram was constructed based on the results of the multivariable analyses. P We validated the nomogram by applying calibration curves, concordance index (C-index), time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and decision-curve analysis (DCA). The AUC and C-index values varied from .5 to 1.0, with .5 denoting random chance and 1.0 denoting perfect discrimination.

We simultaneously included the variables of moderate/severe anemia and mild anemia as the dummy variables in the models, and no anemia was considered as a reference. We adjusted the clinically relevant variables to estimate the adjusted HRs in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.

The adjustment for all\u2010cause mortality was a combination of these factors.

In each stratum, DPP-4 inhibitor users were assigned a weight of 1, while sulfonylurea users were weighted in proportion to the number exposed in the corresponding stratum. This method estimates the average treatment effect among the treated, that is, the DPP-4 inhibitor group.

Covariate balance before and after weighting were assessed using standardized differences, with a difference of less than 0.10 indicative of good balance.31Weighted incidence rates of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, with 95% CIs based on the Poisson distribution, were calculated for each exposure group. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to display the cumulative incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer for the exposure groups over the follow-up period. Finally, weighted Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate HRs with 95% CIs of incident melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer in the respective cohorts, comparing DPP-4 inhibitors with sulfonylureas.

Scatterplots of the relationship among each pair of variables indicated that relationships were not linear. As such, Spearman correlations (rs) were used to reflect the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship among each pair of variables. All variables were candidates for inclusion in a stepwise, multivariable regression model of variables associated with the iHOT-33 average score. The stepwise regression method selects variables for inclusion or exclusion from the model in a sequential fashion based on the significance level of 0.10 for entry and 0.10 for removal. Variables that do not satisfy the 0.10 threshold for entry in the model are not included in the final multivariable model and thus have no associated p value. The model selects variables that contribute information that is statistically independent of the other variables in the model. Because of the high intercorrelation among the two MEP pain variables coupled with collinearity diagnostics, only one of these variables could be included in the multivariable model. Either of these correlated measures would perform nearly equivalent in the multivariable model. Even though different domains of movement are assessed by squat (mobility) compared with step down (strength and motor control), these correlated measures would be expected to perform nearly equivalent in the multivariable model. A decision was made to include MEP pain during bilateral squat in the primary multivariable model because there was no missing data for this variable. Parameter estimates and corresponding 95% CIs are reported for variables in the multivariable model, adjusted for all variables in the model.

We think that a smaller difference than previously observed, that is, an absolute difference of 20% between groups instead of over 30%, can be considered clinically meaningful. To be able to have 80% power to detect a difference of 20% assuming the success rate in the control group is 43.4%, we need to include at least 94 patients per group when using an alpha of 5% for testing.

Baseline characteristics of the participants were adjusted for age, sex, and region as appropriate by multiple linear regression (for continuous variable) or logistic regression (for categorical variable) models and were described as marginal means or percentages in each group calculated by predicted function of models. Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI for the prospective association between fresh fruit consumption and risk of COPD hospitalization or death, with age as the time scale, and stratification by region (ten regions) and age (in 5-year intervals). Established and potential confounders that may affect the consumption of fresh fruit and the risk of COPD in the population were adjusted for in the multivariable Cox model, including socio-demographic variables, health-related lifestyles, and other dietary factors, which were selected based on prior knowledge and related studies.[1,22,29\u201333]Schoenfeld residuals were used to check the proportional hazards assumption for all Cox models. The linear trend of fresh fruit intake with the risk of COPD-related hospitalization and death in the models was tested by assigning a midpoint value for each fruit consumption category to produce a continuous variable for modeling theP-trend. P To further quantify the effect of fresh fruit consumption on the risk of COPD-related hospitalization and death, and reduce any inaccuracy due to self-reported changes in dietary habits, we estimated the usual amount of fresh fruit intake (portions/month) for each baseline consumption frequency group based on data from the two resurveys [Supplementary Table 1]. The usual amount value was assigned to each corresponding participant to calculate the effect size of one daily portion (i.e., 100 g/day) of fresh fruit consumption in the Cox regression model, and the HRs were plotted for each baseline group to assess the dose-response relationship. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess potential reverse causality: excluding participants who had a history of peptic ulcer or liver cirrhosis at baseline, due to the fact that these medical conditions might affect eating and dietary habits; excluding participants diagnosed with COPD during the first 3 years of follow-up; and restricting the analysis to never-smokers. We also examined the association of fresh fruit consumption with the risk of COPD-related hospitalization and death among various baseline subgroups: sex (male or female), age (<50 years, 50\u201359 years, or \u226560 years), area (rural or urban), smoking status (non-current daily smoker or current daily smoker), drinking status (non-current weekly drinker or current weekly drinker), general adiposity (defined based on BMI: underweight [BMI <18.5 kg/m2], normal [18.5 kg/m2\u2264 BMI <24.0 kg/m2], overweight [24.0 kg/m2\u2264 BMI <28.0 kg/m2], or obese [BMI \u226528.0 kg/m2]), household income (<10,000 Chinese Yuan [CNY]/year, 10,000\u201320,000 CNY/year, or >20,000 CNY/year), and physical activity (tertiles of MET-h/day).Pvalues for interaction were calculated by a likelihood ratio test, comparing models with and without cross product terms between the stratification variables and fresh fruit consumption.

To measure the association between the longitudinal evolution of the thrombus area over time and the hazard of the event of interest unbiasedly, we performed joint modeling.

Multivariable Cox regression and smooth curve-fitting methods were used to examine the independent association between LDH levels and all-cause mortality. Three multivariable models were constructed. Model I was adjusted based on the age (continuous, years), sex (male or female), race (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other including multiracial), educational level (< 9 years, 9\u201313 years or \u226513 years), and Poverty Income Ratio (continuous). In model II, the results were further adjusted based on the BMI (continuous), smoking status (never, former, and current), and medical history (diabetes, hypertension, CVD, stroke, and cancer). In model III, the results were adjusted based on the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (continuous), albumin (ALB) (continuous), neutrophil (continuous), hemoglobin (continuous), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (continuous), and FEV1% predicted (continuous). Furthermore, a two-piecewise linear regression model with a smoothing curve was used to examine the nonlinear relationship between LDH levels and all-cause mortality. One-line linear regression was compared with two-piecewise linear regression using likelihood ratio tests. To determine the threshold value, we chose the point with the highest likelihood among all possible values. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to further evaluate the robustness of the results.

Other covariates were sex, age dichotomised using the median (below or equal to 60 and above 60 years old), education (none or primary, secondary, or higher education), and working status (employed, unemployed, and non-responder). All categorical variables were summarised as counts and percentages, and their statistical association was assessed through the Chi-square or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Crude odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the association between study outcomes and each covariate.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate whether high TMB cancers are associated with longer survival in patients treated with ICI than low TMB cancers in the evaluable cohort. A stratified Cox proportional hazards model was fit with stratification by line of therapy (first-line or second-line) with study entry defined as the start of ICI treatment. To account for immortal time bias in OS, corrected study entry was defined as the assay order date if the assay order date occurred after the start of ICI treatment. Risk set adjustment was implemented, in which patients were only considered to be at risk for the OS end point according to the corrected study entry time. The test for significance of the hazard ratio (HR) was performed using a 1-sided Wald test at a 5% significance level. Mathematically, this translates to assessing if the one-sided upper 95% confidence bound on the HR was less than 1. Therefore, the one sided upper 95% confidence bound is provided for all survival analyses. Similarly, stratified Cox models were fit for the PFS and TTP end points. For an initial anticipated cohort size of 850 patients, simulation studies demonstrated more than 80% power for the primary end point. All secondary analyses were conducted in the prospective cohort only as prespecified for the following reasons: the prospective cohort mirrors the design of a prospective clinical trial, it is reflective of how TMB would be used clinically for ICI decision-making, and finally, it limits potential confounders of the tumor environment impacted by early initiation of ICI treatment without TMB result and immortal time bias. For multivariable analyses, other covariates such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry status and MSI status were added to the model as main variables. Similarly, stratification by line of therapy was included in all multivariable Cox proportional hazards models which included patients for whom first-line and second-line ICI were indicated. All comparisons of TMB-H with TMB-L cancers were performed using the Wald test at an unadjusted 5% significance level. In individual cancer types, 1-year survival probabilities were compared for TMB-H vs TMB-L cancers.

In the first analysis (model 1), we assessed the crude association between socioeconomic status and GDM. Model 2 for the association between socioeconomic status and GDM included maternal age and parity. We estimated the aORs by including other covariates in model 2.

To assess effect modification by socioeconomic status, we assessed interactions on both multiplicative and additive scales, as recommended by VanderWeele and Knol.12To test the interaction hypothesis on the multiplicative scale, we categorized the sample based on both socioeconomic status and maternal age, and the stratum with the lowest risk was selected as the reference category. We then compared the aORs against this sole reference category.

Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first aimed to identify risk factors associated with persistent high turnover. The second aimed to investigate the association between persistent high turnover and practice-level outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression panel data model with random effects was used to quantify the association between risk factors and persistent high turnover. The outcome persistent high turnover was modelled as a binary outcome, according to whether a practice experienced or not persistent high turnover (classified as 1 and 0, respectively). Multivariable linear regression panel data models with random effects were used to investigate the association between persistent high turnover and the various outcomes. Additionally, the Hausman test and the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier were used to assess whether random effects were justified for these models.

An interaction term for miscarriage (yes/no) and GA was introduced in the linear mixed model to calculate the difference in GA between ongoing pregnancies and pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. The calculated difference can be expressed as a delay in reaching the final Carnegie stage, Stage 23. t et al. The odds of a miscarriage per Carnegie stage were calculated using a two-step approach. First, we fitted a mixed model for the longitudinal Carnegie scores. Using this model, we were able to generate predictions of the Carnegie stage for given GAs given all observations before this time point. This predicted Carnegie stage is now used in a logistic regression model estimated with generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an independent working correlation to predict the event of a miscarriage. The GEE is used to assess the odds of a miscarriage. The GEE analysis was performed for Model 1 and the fully adjusted Model 2. A joint model was used to assess the chance of a miscarriage based on the delay of Carnegie stage per pregnancy. A joint model incorporates multiple longitudinal measurements and time-to-event outcomes (Papageorgiouet al., 2019). The joint longitudinal model utilizes all the repeated measurements on pregnancy, irrespective of timing and number of observations, without using imputed data. The model combines linear mixed modelling and survival analysis, and is expressed as a hazard ratio (HR) for the event miscarriage. First, a linear mixed model is constructed for Carnegie stages as a predictor for miscarriage. Then the time-to-event is incorporated into the joint model. The random effects in the linear mixed model account for both the association between the longitudinal repeated measurements and the time-to-event outcome (Papageorgiouet al., 2019). This analysis was performed for Model 1 and the fully adjusted Model 2 using 150\u00a0000 iterations. et al. et al.

Multivariable analyses of the total effect of postoperative complications on DFI and OS were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, CCI, tumour size, tumour location, and vascular resection. Fig. 1 Directed acyclic graph to identify confounders in the association between major postoperative complications and adjuvant chemotherapy, and disease-free interval and overall survival after resection of pancreatic cancer CA, carbohydrate antigen. Adjuvant chemotherapy was considered a mediator for the effect of postoperative complications on DFI and OS, which means that it is an effect of the exposure (complications) and a cause of the outcome (survival). This implies that impaired survival in patients with postoperative complications might be explained by their inability to start with adjuvant chemotherapy because of a delayed recovery26,35,36. To assess the extent of the mediation effect and investigate potential direct effects, a causal mediation analysis was performed. In this analysis, the total effect of complications on survival is decomposed into a direct effect and an indirect effect via adjuvant chemotherapy26. The statistical approach is based on three independent regression analyses, which are used to calculate estimates for each of these effects. This enables the calculation of counterfactual outcomes if the observed mediation status (that is adjuvant chemotherapy) was hypothetically set to another level27. The total effect was calculated using an accelerated failure time (AFT) model with Weibull distribution26. The indirect effect was based on two calculations: the independent association between the complication and adjuvant chemotherapy was established using a logistic regression model adjusted for relevant confounders (that is age, sex, CCI, tumour size, and vascular resection); and the independent association between adjuvant chemotherapy and survival was assessed using an AFT model adjusted for the concerning complication and potential confounders (that is age, sex, number of resected positive lymph nodes, tumour differentiation, resection margin status, tumour size, preoperative CA 19-9, and neural invasion). Finally, the unstandardized total, direct and indirect effects were computed with 100 simulations. Results are presented as effect estimates, derived from the causal mediation analysis as average causal mediation effects (ACME; the indirect effect) and average direct effects (ADE; the direct effect). For example, a calculated negative indirect effect indicates a negative impact of the postoperative complication on survival that is fully attributable to not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. A calculated negative direct effect indicates that the systemic inflammatory response leading to local tumour growth fully explains the impaired survival. Results from the independent regression analyses are presented as odds ratios (OR) (resulting from the logistic regression model) and HR (calculated using the AFT model) with corresponding 95 per cent c.i.

The intervention\u2019s effects on outcomes were estimated using generalised linear mixed models. To account for the data\u2019s nested structure, two random effects were put into the model: one random intercept for the recruitment site and another for participants nested within that recruitment site. Two models were fitted. Model 1 included the fixed effects of the intervention (vcontrol), time (three monthsvsix months; 12 monthsvsix months), and the baseline values of the outcome. In model 1, the estimate of the intervention variable reflects the intervention\u2019s main effect during the follow-up period, independent of time. Two additional intervention-by-time interactions (ie, intervention-by-three months; intervention-by-12 months) were added to model 2. These two interaction terms estimated how much the intervention effects at three and 12 months differed from those at six months. To test whether intervention effects differed significantly between follow-ups, the overall effect of the two interaction terms was estimated using a likelihood ratio test comparing models 1 and 2. In model 2, the intervention\u2019s estimated main effect corresponds to the intervention effect (vcontrol) conditional to the time, coded 0, namely, the intervention effect at the set reference time point. By changing the reference group for the two dummy variables of time, the intervention effects at three months and 12 months could also be estimated. v v v v Count models were used for standard drinks per week, heavy drinking days, maximum number of drinks, and consequences related to alcohol because these variables were not normally distributed. We used tests for Poisson overdispersion to determine whether a Poisson or negative binomial distribution best fitted the data. Overdispersion tests were significant for standard drinks per week and heavy drinking days but not significant for maximum number of drinks and alcohol related consequences. Thus, a negative binomial distribution was used to model standard drinks per week and heavy drinking days, whereas the Poisson distribution was used to model maximum number of drinks and consequences related to alcohol. The distribution for academic performance was approximately normal, and a Gaussian distribution was used. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Technical details of our analyses and multiple imputation are reported in appendix 2.

To identify the speech variables in the picture description task that demonstrated significant decline over time, we employed an exploratory, data-driven approach to test all of the extracted speech variables for significant linear changes over the time period of the observational study in the patient population. We first averaged the values for each variable across the two pictures at each time point and then standardized each speech variable with reference to the group mean and standard deviation. Using linear mixed models with the fixed effects of time (in months), age at enrollment, sex, stimulus version (which varied across the time points), and random intercepts to account for baseline individual variations, we tested each variable for significant effects of time (P< 0.05), indicating significant change over the course of the study. Due to the exploratory nature of this step, we did not perform multiple comparison correction. Based on previous and internal unpublished research, we chose to control for the effects of age, sex, and stimulus version in the linear model because variations in these factors have been shown to affect speech and language patterns (Cho, Nevler, Shellikeri, et al, 2021). Due to incomplete data on years of education and time since diagnosis, we did not add these factors to the models. P To further refine the set of speech variables, we selected those variables that showed consistent scores across the first three time points. To do so, we tested the ICC between the variable scores at months 1, 2, and 3. Variables that had significant ICCs >0.5 (P< 0.05) between the first three time points (which occurred within 2 months of one another) were selected as having moderate or higher test\u2013retest reliability (Koo and Li, 2016). From this set of speech variables, we eliminated redundant variables based on whether \u22652 of the variables had very high correlations (r> 0.9) and measured similar constructs to one another. In cases where two variables were correlated (r> 0.9), we selected the variable that had a greater effect of time in the linear model and removed the other variable. P r r To combine the selected set of variables, we assigned equal positive or negative weights based on the direction of the time effect and summed the standardized variables to create a single composite score. To validate this score, we used linear mixed models to test for the effect of change over time and tested the test\u2013retest reliability over the first three time points using the ICC. We processed the speech data from the HC in the same way as the speech data from the FTD group. The values for each of the selected variables were averaged across the two pictures at the baseline assessment and were standardized with reference to the group means and standard deviations that we calculated for the FTD group, so that values were comparable across groups on the same scale. The composite score was computed in the identical way for the HC. The demographics of the HC were compared to the demographics of the FTD group using a two-samplettest for age and a \u03c72test for sex. t We developed custom variables for each speech task (ie, picture description, paragraph reading and recall, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency, and object naming) in order to provide an accuracy score for each task in the speech assessment. For picture description, scoring involves calculating the ratio of how many items in the picture were correctly named out of all of the items in each picture. For paragraph reading, scoring involves calculating the word error rate by dividing the number of deviations from the paragraph text by the total number of expected words. For paragraph recall, scoring involves calculating a recall score by assessing the proportion of story details that were remembered correctly. For phonemic and semantic fluency, scoring involves counting how many words were correctly generated in 60 seconds based on the prompt (ie, first letter for phonemic fluency, semantic category for semantic fluency). For object naming, scoring involves calculating a naming score by assessing the proportion of correctly named images out of the three. All of these scores were automatically computed based on the speech transcripts using custom code. Correlations between the standardized speech composite score and the standardized speech task scores were computed at baseline using Pearson correlations.",

Two stepwise linear models were estimated, a 2-step model with 1 slope from 0 to 6 months and a second slope from 6 to 24 months, while the 3-step model included a third slope from months 12 to 24. For the free-loading model, only baseline and 24-month loadings were fixed (to 0 and 1, respectively) and other loadings were estimated from the data. These models serve to identify different periods of change and may provide superior fit to a single linear slope (which assumes a constant rate of change) or curvilinear, quadratic equation (which assumes a constant rate of change in linear slope, including an ultimate reversal of initial direction). Collectively, the range of models allow for a comprehensive evaluation of possible symptom trajectories including across early, middle, and later timepoints. All growth models included covariances among the intercept and all slopes. Seefigure 1for hypothetical visualizations of linear, curvilinear, and stepwise linear trajectory models. Hypothetical linear, curvilinear, and stepwise growth curve models. Models of differences in trajectory by relevant baseline patient characteristics (depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, functioning, age), and clinical subgroups (DS, PNS, transition) explored moderation of the best fitting growth curve intercept and slope by the moderator of interest. Moderators were entered as correlated predictors of negative symptom intercept and slope terms within the SEM framework to provide an interpretation similar to coefficients in multiple regression. Full Information Maximum Likelihood was used for all models except where transition was entered as an exogenous variable to account for missing data. Whether transition predicted latent growth trajectory was estimated using the probit link function and pairwise maximum likelihood with missing data handled through pairwise deletion. Fit indices were evaluated for each model, including \u03c72, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), Akaike information criteria (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC), root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR). Greater \u03c72values indicate worse fit but are heavily influenced by sample size, CFI >0.95 indicates strong fit; TLI >0.95 indicates strong fit; AIC is a relative index of fit; BIC is a relative index of fit; RMSEA <0.08 indicates adequate fit; SRMR <0.08 indicates good fit.36\u201340As sensitivity analyses, latent growth curve models were also evaluated as mixed-effects models.41",

Crude measures of event occurrence for each outcome were presented as frequency and incidence rates per 1000 person years for each index eGFR category and age group. Associations between eGFR categories and outcomes were examined using Cox regression models, with follow-up from index date until the first of outcome of interest or censoring (emigration or end of study). Models were constructed for each age group to estimate hazard ratios relative to age specific reference eGFR categories. Models were adjusted for sex, income quintile, hypertension, diabetes, and past cardiovascular disease. Models were also adjusted for other covariates (ie, obesity,44alcoholism, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hyperkalemia,45cancer, chronic liver disease,46chronic lung disease47), urban/rural living status, and healthcare use variables (ie, specialist visit or emergency department visit within five years pre-index). The proportional hazards assumption was assessed graphically for index eGFR categories and covariates in all models using Kaplan-Meier curves and Schoenfeld residuals.4849We also repeated analyses for the kidney failure outcome to model the competing risk of all cause mortality because older participants might have died of other causes before reaching end-stage kidney disease.50 We conducted predefined stratified analyses for those aged 18-39 years by sex and history of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which have been identified as important risk factors for both chronic kidney disease and adverse outcomes. Multiplicative interactions were evaluated in the overall cohort by use of an interaction term of the stratifying variable and continuous index eGFR and in the subgroups by use of an interaction term with categorized index eGFR. Among people with albumin to creatinine ratio measurements within a year of index date, we also examined associations of outcomes with interacting categories of index eGFR and these ratios, stratified by age group, and relative age specific reference category with ratio values of less than 3 mg/mmol. For those with albumin to creatinine ratio measures after index, follow-up started at the date of index albumin to creatinine ratio measurement to prevent potential immortal time bias. Additionally, we repeated similar models as the main analyses among those aged 18-39 years without an eligible albumin to creatinine ratio measure to assess the effect of this value on the results. Both stratified models and models of interacting index eGFRs and albumin to creatinine ratios were adjusted for the same aforementioned covariates.

Other explanatory variables that may affect selection results include region and tier of medical schools, grade year, the orientation of education programmes (eg, rural programmes, 5-year programmes, 8-year or 5+3 programmes) and specialty of education programmes. We controlled these variables to investigate whether pilot reform programmes select different groups of candidates, all else being equal. PP and TP students were compared concerning entrance examination (NCEE) scores and sociodemographic variables. Differences between group means were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and differences in proportions between groups were analysed using the \u03c72test for categorical variables.

In addition, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method using the \u2018EnvStats\u2019 package18of the statistical software R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) was also used for estimation of summary statistics. Using the MLE method, analyses were restricted to industries with at least two non-missing, non-censored, distinct levels. For evaluation of temporal trends in occupational exposure to lead, multiple imputation technique1920was used for measurements less than LOD. Lead measurements were log-transformed and imputation was then performed for retrieval of five complete datasets. A mixed-effects regression model integrating log-transformed lead measurements as the dependent variable and treating year as an independent fixed effect and 3-digit industry as a random effect was then developed. The mixed-effects model was chosen over the fixed-effects model because, in a fixed-effects model, substantial weights tend to be assigned to industries with a large number of measurements, while small industries would essentially be ignored.21By application of a mixed-effects model, we attempted to mitigate the imbalanced distribution of the number of measurements across industries. The model was fitted for five complete datasets respectively using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Analyses were performed using the \u2018lme4\u2019 package22of the statistical software R.

Anatomic locations and treatments of DVT events were analyzed descriptively. Risk factors for early DVT were analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Cox proportional hazards models were also used to investigate outcomes of death-censored graft failure, death with graft function, total graft failure and first hospital readmission after DVT event. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to analyze associations between DVT and post-transplant outcomes. Violations of the proportionality assumptions were checked using log(\u2212log[S(t)]) plots and the interactions between the risk factors with time and Schoenfeld residuals (no significant departures from proportionality were detected). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves stratified by early DVT were produced for each outcome. Linear regression was used to analyze eGFR at 6 and 12 months after transplant.

Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) [24], a propensity score method, was used to adjust baseline variables distributed differently between groups. The propensity score was estimated using a logistic regression model that included all potential confounders that were distributed differently between groups (age [categorized as under and above 70\u00a0years], gender, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, smoking, neoplasia, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], eGFR), or that could have clinical relevance (presentation as ACS). We then performed a balance assessment, comparing the distribution of measured baseline covariates between the treatment groups before and after weighting using standardized differences, which are less sensitive to sample size than conventionalpvalues. As a rule of thumb, a standardized difference of 0.10 or less may be considered a negligible imbalance between groups (Supplementary Table\u00a01).

    "32058": "In survival analysis, it is usual to model the progression of a disease that can occupy several states over time (e.g., alive without disease, recurrence, metastasis, mortality). Studies analyzing complex disease behavior often use multistate models that have been extensively developed over the last few decades (22). Multistate models can be used to model the transition of patients among the various states. In these models, issues of interest include estimating progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, hazard ratios of transitions between disease complications, or prognostic forecasting (23). This study used a multistate time-to-event model as the main statistical method for modeling, incorporating three transient states and a final absorbing state. (State 1: breast cancer diagnosis, state 2: recurrence, state 3: metastasis, and state 4: mortality). We assumed that a continuous-time homogenous Markov process explores the transition intensity times between these finite complication states in breast cancer patients. The suitable theoretical multistate model for the study was considered asFig. 1. The theoretical transitions of complications of breast cancer In the state\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis, patients are biologically at risk of experiencing recurrence, metastasis and mortality simultaneously, and after recurrence they are biologically at risk of experiencing metastasis and mortality simultaneously in terms of competitive risks. The frequency of the observed transition between states from row to column in our sample is shown inTable 1. We specified the multistate models in which the transition intensity matrix is conducted by the Q matrix. Number of observed transitions between states (row and column) during study period in the breast cancer patients Variables Variables Total entering Total entering Recurrence Recurrence Metastasis Metastasis Mortality Mortality No event No event In the Q matrix,q34shows the transition from state 3 to state 4. By implementing the homogenous Markov multistate model, we estimated the Q matrix\u2019s transition intensity, which represents the instant risk of movement from state R to state S. q Due to specified Q matrix transitions in this model, there are six transitions which were numbered in the following order: (i) diagnosis to recurrence, (ii) diagnosis to metastasis, (iii) diagnosis to mortality (absorbing state), (iv) recurrence to metastasis, (v) recurrence to mortality and (vi) metastasis to mortality. We examined different covariates to select the most effective independent variables for the final multistate analysis of the assumed model by interring them into the univariate multistate model alone once. We selected the variables which had a significant effect in at least one transition as influential variables for the final analysis. Finally, the variables age, lymph node, educational level, estrogen receptor status, and tumor size were selected as the desired risk factors of our final model. The parametric continuous-time multistate model was used to estimate the effect of the study covariates on transitions between states (24). The transition hazard denotes the instantaneous risk of a subject\u2019s moving from one state of disease to another. It is determined by the current time and individual characteristics. The competing risks are considered by estimating cause-specific hazards (25). The data were analyzed using free R statistical software version 3.6.0. (mstate package).",

    "42580": "We evaluated study drug impact on log10-transformed viral load on day 5 and day 10 with a linear Tobit regression model where the effect of study drugs was allowed to differ on day 5 and day 10. This was decided a priori as a rigorous analytic approach to account for left censoring due to the viral load limit of quantification. Repeated measures were accounted for using clustered standard errors within participants. Analyses of viral loads estimated the adjusted mean reduction averaged over time and the adjusted mean reduction at day 5 and at day 10. We evaluated impact over time on the probability of viral load being undetectable using generalized estimating equations with a logistic link; estimates are reported as odds ratios and risk differences. The COVID-OUT trial was a 2 by 3 factorial design of parallel distinct treatments (Table S2). All analyses were adjusted for baseline viral load, vaccination status, time since last vaccination for those vaccinated before enrollment, receipt of other study medications within factorial trial, lab that processed the nasal swabs, and exact time/date of specimen collection. Additional detail and the results of the analysis with dropping of adjustment variables are presented inTable S8,Table S9. To handle missing values, we used multiple imputation with chained equations to multiply impute missing viral load outcomes and vaccination status. Missing covariate information was jointly imputed along with missing outcomes using random forests for the univariate imputation models; along with outcome and vaccination status information, imputation models were informed by sex, BMI, symptom duration, race/ethnicity, baseline comorbidities, clinical outcomes, and enrollment time categorized by the dominant pandemic variant. Complete case analysis without imputation of missing data is presented inFigures S2\u2013S4.",

We used descriptive statistics to generate the average travel miles and minutes for medical/dental care by rural\u2013urban residence, and race/ethnicity for each study year. We also calculated the percentage of those who traveled for\u00a0\u2265\u00a030 miles or minutes for medical/dental care, and for work, by rural\u2013urban status. In conducting trend analysis, we used linear regression with year as the independent variable and average travel distance/time as the dependent variable to determine whether there were any statistically significant changes over time. No covariates were considered in the trend analysis. This is consistent with guidelines outlined in the literature for conducting trend analysis with few time points (Ingram et al., 2018). For travel distance and time, we used multiple ordinary least squares regressions to further test whether the rural\u2013urban differences had changed over time. We included the interaction term \u201cRural/urban status\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Year\u201d to test these changes. We used separate multivariable logistic regressions to estimate the adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals of a higher travel burden among racial/ethnic populations living in rural and urban areas. To describe changes in the odds of a high travel burden over time by race/ethnicity, we included an interaction term for \u201cRace/Ethnicity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Year\u201d in the regression models. We also generated interaction plots to demonstrate changes in the predicted probability of these outcomes. Observations with missing data on covariates were excluded from the regression via listwise deletion (n\u00a0=\u00a03,185). In all statistical tests, the alpha level of significance was set at 0.05.

Patients randomized to receive ET alone prior to the amendment 3 and who started therapy were excluded from the mITT set but still belong to the safety analysis set, and they were analyzed descriptively. The median PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method based on the mITT population; 6- and 12-month rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented. Median follow-up was computed using the inverse Kaplan-Meier curve censored at death. Follow-up completeness was estimated according to Clark et al. [18]. CBR and the associated two-sided 95% CIs were reported descriptively. Frequencies of patients whose treatment had to be reduced, interrupted, or prematurely discontinued were given together with reasons for such modifications. Incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AESI were displayed descriptively. QoL analyses were based on the FACT-B questionnaire whose scales were computed according to the respective scoring manual [19]. The calculated FACT-B Trial Outcome Index (FACT-B TOI) is presented per treatment arm at baseline, after 3 months, after 6 months, and at the last assessment as boxplots. Deterioration in FACT-B TOI was defined as a decrease of 5 or more score points from baseline. Time to deterioration (TTD) was defined as the time from enrollment to deterioration or death. Incidence rates for TTD at 12 months were calculated by means of the cumulative incidence function whereby end of treatment was considered as competing risk.

ANOVA and chi-square tests were used to compare means and frequencies among subgroups of patients respectively. Nonparametric methods were used where appropriate. Survival analysis was performed to follow patients, and Cox proportional hazards models using the robust variance estimator were used to explore the relationship between exposure to PHPT and clinical outcomes. This was to accommodate varying duration of follow-up. A separate analysis estimating the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI associated with PHPT was performed for each of the outcomes of interest. Log-rank test of equality across strata were obtained for all categorical covariates, and univariate Cox models were fitted for the continuous covariates to explore whether or not to include them also in the multivariate model. Categorical covariates were included as dummy variables. Unadjusted and adjusted models were stratified by the matched sets of subjects on age and gender (ie, matched analysis). Unmatched analysis was done in corrected models for serum vitamin D concentration by breaking the matched sets to overcome sample size constraints. These models were then stratified by the tertile average serum vitamin D concentration during the follow-up and adjusted for the matched variables (ie, age and gender). Exposure was coded as binary (ie, ever vs never had PHPT) as well as dummy variables to consider 3 levels of exposure (ie, never had PHPT, definite PHPT, and probable PHPT). Sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings were conducted by competing risk regression models where death was the competing event. Model specification was evaluated using goodness of fit diagnostics by computing Harrell's C coefficient, and a test of the proportional hazards assumption was performed for each covariate and globally using a formal significance test based on Schoenfeld residuals (25).

We used a robust variance estimator to account for within-participant homogeneity in outcomes induced by weighting. We derived weights from a propensity score representing the predicted probability of receiving 1 or more COVID-19 vaccine dose(s) during pregnancy.35To reduce variability induced by extreme weights, we used stabilized weights and trimmed values to the 99th percentile.35We assessed balance of covariates between the weighted exposure groups using standardized differences with values more than 0.1 indicating potentially clinically important imbalance.35 We carried out several subgroup and sensitivity analyses: (1) we conducted a dose-response analyses for 1, 2, and 3 vaccine doses during pregnancy; (2) we restricted the exposed group to infants of mothers who received 1 or more dose(s) in the first, second, or third trimesters; (3) we assessed outcomes in infants of mothers who received BNT162b2 only, mRNA-1273 only, or heterologous mRNA vaccine products during pregnancy; (4) we limited the unvaccinated group to mothers who received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose postpartum; a previous study in Ontario found this group had baseline characteristics more similar to women vaccinated during pregnancy than those never vaccinated18and there is no evidence suggesting COVID-19 vaccination postpartum is harmful to breastfed infants36; (5) we excluded infants of mothers with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy; (6) because there are sex differences in the prevalence of congenital anomalies, which are major risk factors for neonatal morbidity and death,37we tested for effect modification by infant sex; (7) we excluded infants who were born at less than 37 weeks\u2019 gestation; (8) we excluded birth trauma from the Neonatal Adverse Outcome Indicator, since this is unlikely to be impacted by maternal COVID-19 vaccination; (9) we calculated weighted RRs and HRs without trimming extreme weights; and (10) for the neonatal and 6-month readmission outcomes, we excluded infants with a birth admission longer than 7 days. To assess the sensitivity of results to the effects of residual confounding from unmeasured confounders, we performed a quantitative bias analysis using the array approach described by Schneeweiss.38Briefly, we modeled 2 potential scenarios for each outcome: (1) a higher prevalence of a variable in vaccinated mothers that decreases the risk of an adverse outcome (ie, a protective confounder; RR, 0.2-0.9) and (2) a lower prevalence of a variable in vaccinated mothers that increases the risk of an adverse outcomes (ie, a harmful confounder; RR, 1.5-5). We assumed a confounder prevalence of 20% in unvaccinated mothers and considered a prevalence range of 20% to 35% and 5% to 20% for a protective and harmful confounder in vaccinated mothers, respectively.30We expressed the degree of bias as a proportion (ie, percent bias\u2009=\u2009[(observed RR\u2009\u2013\u2009bias corrected RR)\u2009/\u2009(bias corrected RR\u2009\u2013\u20091)] \u00d7 100).38We performed analyses using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).",

HRU was compared between the 2 cohorts using generalized linear regression models with a log link and a negative binomial distribution; duration of follow-up period was used as the offset variable. Results were reported as unadjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to evaluate which patient characteristics (independent variables) may be associated with non-response (dependent variable). Independent variables considered in the model included patient demographic and clinical characteristics measured at the date of the first H1AH-based treatment prescription and during the baseline period, such as age, sex, race, region, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), timing of first diagnosis of CSU, CSU-related symptoms, comorbidities, treatments, and laboratory tests. A penalization parameter to remove irrelevant variables was optimized through cross-validation (ie, the selected value of the penalization parameter was that for which the resulting model had the best performance on unseen folds of data). Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding p-values were reported for each predictor included in the model. To supplement the LASSO regression, random forest was used to identify additional predictors of non-response. Random forest allowed for the use of a broad and agnostic set of candidate predictors while avoiding numerical issues like overfitting the data; it permitted the discovery of novel and possibly unexpected predictors of non-response. It allowed for a nonlinear relationship between the predictors and the outcome and was able to account for complex interactions between variables when building a prediction. Random forest consists of an ensemble of classification trees generated using bootstrap samples and randomly selected features; therefore, the individual decision trees do not have access to the entire dataset, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Patients are classified as non-responders or responders based on the majority vote of predictions across trees. Random forest hyperparameters, including tree depth and minimum node size, were optimized using cross-validation to prevent model overfitting. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). All diagnoses, treatments, procedures, laboratory tests, and symptoms available in the EHR were considered as the initial candidate predictors; no limit was imposed on the number of predictors included in the initial model since various aspects of a patient's medical journey could be related to CSU, comorbidities, general health, and thus, response/non-response to treatment. A threshold level of variable importance was optimized to remove variables that performed worse than random noise, thus reducing the risk of identifying predictors by chance. In both LASSO and random forest models, the predictive strength of a variable was determined based on its combined effect with other variables. Of note, a variable can be an important predictor of non-response without there necessarily being significant differences between responders and non-responders.",

Approximate SEs for MDs between three dosage groups and placebo were conservatively based on worst casep-values (e.g., for \u201cstatistically significant at 0.01 level,\u201d we assumedp= 0.01) and using methods for Waldz-tests [35] while assuming that adjusted differences in the mean change were the same as the observed differences. These SEs ranged from 2.33 to 2.58. For the lowest dose group in comparison with placebo, for which we only knowp>\u00a00.1, we assumed an SE of 2.42, which is the average of the SEs for the other group comparisons. We combined the dosage groups by averaging the individual MDs and by estimating the SE for the combined group as the square root of the sum of the individual squared SEs and dividing by the number of SEs (i.e., conservatively assuming independence). p p p z p From the studies that reported baseline SDs for SF-36 vitality scores, one study by Dudley\u2013Brown [30] reported SDs of approximately 20, whereas the four studies by Sands and Pan\u00e9s [29,33] reported SDs of approximately 10. All of these studies were reasonably large, and the most likely explanation for the difference between them was that Sands and Pan\u00e9s applied stricter inclusion criterion than Dudley-Brown, in that the included participants had an inadequate response or intolerance to other therapy. Ghosh [34] used similarly strict inclusion criteria but did not report the baseline SD for FACIT-F. In this situation with likely true differences in variance, the recommendation is to standardize using common, possibly external, estimates of SD [36]. For FACIT-F, Danese et al. [37] reported baseline SDs of 11.3 and 11.7 (average 11.5) for two equally sized groups of 220 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn\u2019s disease in the STARDUST trial. To match the inclusion criteria of this trial, we used the baseline SDs reported in Dudley\u2013Brown [30] for SF-36 vitality (i.e., 19.4 forn= 259 in the treatment arm and 19.3 forn= 250 in the placebo arm, with a weighted average of 19.4). In summary, to calculate SMDs and accompanying SEs, we divided by an SD of 11.5 for FACIT-F and an SD of 19.4 for SF-36 vitality, giving SMDs that are generalizable to populations with moderate-to-severe IBD. n n Given the differences between the studies with regard to the disease population, intervention medications, and dosage schemes, we opted to perform a random effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method [38]. With this method, we assume that the observed treatment effects are a random sample from a distribution of treatment effects with a variance of\u03c42, the estimate of which is included in the calculation of study weights. Heterogeneity was further assessed using theI2statistic, which estimates the percentage of between-study heterogeneity attributable to variability in the true treatment effect rather than sampling variation, and tested it using\u03c72[38]. With substantial heterogeneity, various subgroup analyses were explored, though without pursuing a full meta-regression due to the small number of studies. \u03c4 I \u03c7 Forest plots of the estimated SMDs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to visualize the range of effects, with the relative size of the markers indicating the weight of each point estimate in the calculation of the combined estimate. Possible small study effects were illustrated using a funnel plot and tested with the Egger test. Supplementary analyses were performed with within-study dosage groups treated separately while sharing the placebo comparator group. An overall MD based on the studies applying SF-36 vitality as fatigue instrument were estimated. All analyses were performed using Stata v.17.0 functions metan and metafunnel.",

The follow\u2010up period started at the date of conscription (baseline) and ended on December 31, 2017. Subjects were followed up until a first acute coronary event, death from any other cause, emigration, or end of follow\u2010up (December 31, 2017), whichever occurred first. For descriptive baseline data, BMI was categorized into 8 groups (<18.5, 18.5\u201319.99, 20\u201322.49, 22.5\u201324.99, 25\u201327.49, 27.5\u201329.99, 30\u201334.99, and \u226535 kg/m2). Incidence rates and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using Poisson regression. To estimate hazard ratios (HRs), we started with ordinary Cox proportional hazards models by plotting the weighted Schoenfeld residuals (using categorical BMI); these, however, showed significant violations of the proportional hazards assumption. Therefore, we used piece\u2010wise exponential additive models within the generalized additive model framework24to allow for more flexible modeling of the interaction between BMI and time. From a nontechnical perspective, these models are similar to the Cox model and can in one form yield virtually identical estimates. In contrast to the Cox model, the baseline hazard can be explicitly modeled by a spline, and hence they provide greater flexibility to model interactions between covariates and time (ie, nonproportional hazards). The models were estimated in R using the mgcv package,25which is an R package for inter alia, estimating generalized additive models. All continuous covariates (ie, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, calendar year, and age) were modeled using thin plate regression splines. We decomposed the interaction between age and BMI into mains and interaction effects; the interaction part used a tensor smooth with cubic regression spline basis. Restricted maximum likelihood was used for selecting the smoothing parameter for the splines. HRs and cumulative incidences were calculated from the model, where the latter used fixed covariate values (BMI as indicated in the figure; systolic blood pressure 130\u2009mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure 68\u2009mm Hg; test center 1; middle group for muscle strength, IQ, fitness, and parental education; and no congenital heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension at baseline) over the range of time (age 18\u201368\u2009years and calendar year 1968\u20132018). As the model does not account for competing risks, the cumulative incidence may be slightly overestimated; however, comparing a Kaplan\u2010Meier curve with one adjusted for competing risks showed almost no overestimation before the age of 60\u2009years, and only slightly after that (around 0.02 for the worst case). To avoid underestimating the true risk associated with high adolescent BMI, we refrained from adjusting for follow\u2010up comorbidities, such as diabetes or hypertension, conditions that in themselves are strongly associated with an elevated BMI and constitute steps in the pathway toward atherosclerosis. Categorical variables were conscription test center, cardiorespiratory fitness, overall muscle strength, IQ, and parental education. Cardiorespiratory fitness was trichotomized as low (1\u20134), moderate (5\u20137), or high (8\u20139), and muscle strength was trichotomized as low (1\u20133), moderate (4\u20136), or high (7\u20139). Parental education was defined as low (preschool, \u22649\u2009years), medium (high school, 10\u201312\u2009years), or high (university and higher, >12\u2009years). Differences among regions, examination years, and age at conscription were considered potential confounders and adjusted for. Because inpatient discharge data are complete from 1987, sensitivity analyses for events occurring before the age of 40\u2009years before and after 1987 were performed. Also, to account for potential reverse causality, a sensitivity analysis of excluding any events before the age of 30\u2009years was performed. In addition, we tested the interaction of BMI and the covariates in separate models by including a tensor smooth for continuous covariates. For categorical covariates, we included separate spline form BMI for each category in addition to the main effect for BMI.

To account for the different operational characteristics of hospitals and the expected few number of deaths, we used Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models with population stratification by hospitals incorporated as random intercepts for our multivariable analyses. Informative priors were based on existing literature on the association between covariates and 30-day postoperative mortality10\u201312and experts in the study group. Covariates in the multivariable model on 30-day mortality included the World Bank income groups, age groups, sex, WHO performance status, ASA status, urgency of surgery, and postoperative respiratory complications. Sensitivity analysis using weakly informative priors assessed the influence of informative priors on the posterior distributions. Credible interval (CrI) represented the 95% highest density interval of the posterior distributions, which can be interpreted as 95% confidence interval but is philosophically distinct. WHO performance status may have different prognostic value depending on the context; a model including an interaction between income groups and WHO performance status evaluated this potential effect modification. Interaction terms had weakly informative priors. We took a complete case analysis approach. We accepted model as convergent if R-hat diagnostic was <1.05.

Furthermore, we presented baseline characteristics of patients depending on plasma endotrophin concentrations, where a cut-off was arbitrarily defined as the 95th percentile of endotrophin in healthy controls. To assess associations of clinical and biochemical parameters with plasma endotrophin among KTRs, univariable linear regression analyses were performed in cohort A, with log2plasma endotrophin as a dependent variable. We then adjusted for age, sex, creatinine and donor status to identify other independent potential determinants of plasma endotrophin concentrations. Finally, we performed a backwards linear regression model, where variables with aP-value <.10 in univariable analyses were included in the initial model, followed by stepwise exclusion of variables with aP-value >.05.

Patients with hypertension or diabetes typically visit their doctors regularly for prescriptions; thus, these regular patients are hierarchically nested within a prescriber\u2019s cluster. Given that the characteristics of the higher group can influence the outcome in hierarchical data, it is advisable to use multilevel modeling. This approach helps to correct for biases in parameter estimates that may arise from such clustering [19].

As the ICC quantifies the proportion of observed variation in the outcome that is attributable to the effect of clustering, it would be equal to 1 if all subjects in the same cluster exhibited the same response [20].

For hippocampal subfields, we also adjusted for the intracranial volume (ICV). We performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the hippocampal volume, cognitive function, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR in participants. Then, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to determine the independent factors for cognitive function in participants.

The nonlung primary group included patients with disease that originated outside of the lung but comprised solitary or oligometastatic intrathoracic disease treated with SBRT. Patients in the other lung or pleura category were excluded from univariate and multivariate analyses because of the low sample size and variability in histologic subtypes.

In the US, covid-19 and influenza vaccination often occurs in the community or workplace, outside of healthcare settings and without reimbursement by health plans. As a result, documentation of immunization is not complete within US administrative claims and electronic medical record databases.31 32Consequently, we evaluated periods of ambulatory diagnosed covid-19 stratified by availability of covid-19 vaccination. We assessed differences between the covid-19 and influenza cohorts using standardized differences, of which an absolute value of \u22650.1 indicated meaningful imbalance.33For each cohort, we estimated the unadjusted 90 day absolute risk and incidence rates of ATE and VTE with 95% confidence intervals separately and stratified results by demographic characteristics, history of cardiovascular disease or prior VTE, and month at diagnosis (for patients with covid-19 since SARS-CoV-2 variants evolved over time and evaluation for thrombotic complications changed during the course of the pandemic). For all cohorts, we performed a sensitivity analysis accounting for death as a competing risk using the cumulative incidence function.34 We developed propensity scores to control for differences in characteristics between the influenza cohort and each covid-19 cohort. Within each Data Partner, we estimated for each patient a single propensity score using logistic regression, with covid-19 (versus influenza) status as the dependent variable. We excluded patients from each covid-19 cohort whose score exceeded the maximum or minimum values in the influenza cohort and vice versa (ie, trimmed the tails). We used fine stratification of propensity scores to retain the maximum number of patients.35We assigned patients to one of 50 propensity score strata based on quantiles of the score distribution among patients with covid-19. We calculated stratum-specific weights using the distribution of exposure within each stratum to create a weighted population reflecting the characteristics of the overall sample.36We implemented weighted propensity score fine stratification, since traditional unweighted propensity score stratification would likely not provide sufficiently strong confounding control.35 36 We used weighted Cox regression accounting for propensity scores and adjusted for Data Partner to calculate hazard ratios with robust 95% confidence intervals of primary and secondary thrombotic outcomes comparing covid-19 during period 1 or 2 versus influenza.37We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results of the primary analyses to unmeasured confounding using E-values, which represent the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both exposure and outcome to explain an observed association.38Additionally, for primary endpoints, we stratified results by cardiovascular disease (ATE analysis) or prior VTE (VTE analysis). Among patients who had an inpatient ATE or VTE event, we used weighted Cox regression accounting for propensity scores and adjusted for Data Partner to estimate hazard ratios for mortality in the 30 days after the event during each covid-19 period versus influenza. Among patients diagnosed with covid-19 in the ambulatory setting, we evaluated baseline characteristics as risk factors for ATE and VTE on the basis of their potential to promote stasis of circulation, endothelial injury, or hypercoagulability.6Variables included diagnoses of alcohol dependence or misuse, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, atrial fibrillation or flutter, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, cardiovascular disease (for ATE analysis) or VTE (for VTE analysis), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, inherited thrombophilia, neurological diseases that promote immobility (Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease), obesity, pregnancy, polycythemia (diagnosis or hemoglobin >16.0\u2009g/dL), rheumatological disease, thrombocytosis (diagnosis or platelet count >450\u2009000/\u00b5L), and tobacco use. We also evaluated by older age group, sex, and outpatient dispensing of an anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or statin within three to 183 days prior to the index date.

Two outcome variables, COVID-19 cases and deaths per-million population, are highly skewed to the right; hence, a negative binomial regression was considered given the overdispersion of the COVID-19 data. The regression model was estimated within a multilevel structure to account for clustering of monthly COVID-19 data (level-1) within countries (level-2). We considered a country-level random intercept (mixed-effect) model in adjusted analyses and a log-link was applied. Statistical significance of the estimated level-2 variance will suggest whether there is any country-level variation in COVID-19 data (cases and deaths per-million population). The reported likelihood ratio (LR) test will indicate whether a mixed-effect negative binomial provides a better fit over a standard negative binomial regression. For checking robustness of results, we also estimated the regression model using inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation for variables of interests.81The IHS transformation has several advantages such that it can handle skewness, retain zeros and negative values and can overcome drawbacks that generally lie within a natural log transformation.82 The potential confounders mentioned above were used in the adjusted model, along with a \u2018time trend\u2019 and binary quarterly seasonal dummies to evaluate temporal trends and seasonality in COVID-19 cases and deaths per-million population.

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to examine whether proteins were differentially expressed between UTUC and normal, or NMI-UTUCs and MI-UTUCs. Upregulated or downregulated proteins are defined as proteins differentially expressed in one group compared with the other group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, BH p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, Fold change >1.5 or <0.67). Differentially expressed proteins were subjected to Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)70and ConsensusPathwayDB (http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/)63with an FDR <0.05. We used gene sets of molecular pathways from the KEGG71/Reactome72/GO73databases to compute pathways.

For the first aim (final coupling interval that induced VT), the cohort of patients was described by reporting means and standard deviations (SD), medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), and proportions as appropriate. Coupling interval lengths were dichotomized into above and below the thresholds of 200 and 250\u2005ms, respectively. These coupling interval thresholds for analysis were selected by the study investigators based on prior experience conducting PVS and EPS within this patient population. The proportion of patients with a follow-up ventricular tachyarrhythmia was plotted by coupling interval length showing the associated 95% confidence interval (CI). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves graphed time free of ventricular tachyarrhythmia censored at death and time free of the composite event of death and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. A sensitivity analysis treating death and ventricular tachyarrhythmia as competing risks was undertaken to assess the effect of censoring by death. This was graphically presented showing the cumulative incidence, the probability of surviving and experiencing ventricular tachyarrhythmia recurrence prior to that time point, and the probability of experiencing ventricular tachyarrhythmia\u2013free mortality prior to that time point. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to explore the association of time to ventricular tachyarrhythmia recurrence and all baseline covariates (including coupling interval length) using a backwards selection method. Baseline covariates withP< 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the model.

    "2447": "For both the phase IIb data and pooled data, statistical analyses were performed in four steps in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) patient-reported outcome (PRO) industry guidelines for deriving meaningful change thresholds of PROs.31 34In summary, multiple methods were used to estimate meaningful change thresholds, resulting in range of values. These values were then triangulated (ie, the process of converging estimates into a single or small range of values) using predefined criteria. More specifically, FDA and The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) taskforce guidance were followed during triangulation, meaning anchor-based methods were prioritised over distribution-based methods and multiple methods and anchors were used to arrive at a triangulated result.31 34When considering the hierarchy of estimates from the different approaches, anchor-based estimates are assigned more weight than distribution-based estimates, as they are more closely related to the patient perspective. Specific to anchor-based analyses, the proximity of anchor to the target PRO instrument was also considered, with more importance to estimates generated from more closely linked concepts and highly correlated pairings (ie, patient report rather than clinician report). Additionally, to guide triangulation of estimates (but not explicitly define them), graphing assessments using a forest plot were supplemented by a correlation-weighted average31 34of all estimates, where estimates are weighted by the observed correlations between change in anchor and score. An overview of the methods is provided infigure 1. Overview of methods used to examine ESSPRI thresholds of improvement and severity in the phase IIb and pooled analyses. *Phase IIb analyses only. **Pooled analyses only.

An \u2018anchor\u2019 is a simple measure assessing a specific concept used to validate and interpret an instrument assessing the same concept,34in this case symptom severity. Potential anchors were selected based on conceptual overlap with ESSPRI total score and their relevance was confirmed by clinical experts in the research team. Polyserial correlations indicated whether anchors correlated sufficiently (\u22650.3) with ESSPRI total score.34 PaGA and PhGA scores were stratified in three ways: (a) based on literature indicating a 2-point/20\u2009mm change is meaningful35 36; (b) based on stratification used in rheumatic arthritis37and (c) based on literature suggesting 0.5 SD change can be used to support meaningful change thresholds.38Seeonline supplemental table 3for information on how the anchor groups used for meaningful change threshold analyses were defined. Patients were classified as \u2018moderate-major improvement\u2019, \u2018minimal improvement\u2019, \u2018stable\u2019, \u2018minimal worsening\u2019 or \u2018moderate-major worsening\u2019 based on predefined anchor definitions from the literature (seeonline supplemental table 3). To assess whether patients classified as improved had achieved a meaningful benefit, a mixed-effects analysis of covariance model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used to assess whether mean ESSPRI score at week 24 for each group was significantly different and exceeded the score for the minimally improved patients (defined as the least squares mean change score for the minimally improved group). Specifically, the minimal improvement group was relied upon for assessing the smallest amount of change that might be meaningful. The SE of measurement refers to the smallest difference between groups that can be distinguished from measurement error (SEM). Meaningful improvement was also assessed at an individual level to determine how to classify patients in clinical trials as \u2018responders\u2019 based on ESSPRI scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to find the ESSPRI change score that optimally discriminated between groups of patients who were classified as having either a \u2018minimal improvement or better\u2019 versus a \u2018stable or decline\u2019 for each anchor. The optimal cut-off point was determined based on the most sensitive and specific change score using Youden\u2019s J index39(maximising the difference between true positive and false positive rates), and the sum of squares method40(selecting the threshold linearly closest to a perfect classification). ROC curves with an area under the curve (AUC) >0.70 were used to derive ESSPRI meaningful change estimates.41Empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) and probability density function (PDF) curves were also produced to evaluate how well anchors separated the distributions of ESSPRI change scores. Distribution\u2010based estimates of o.5 SD at baseline and 1 SEM at baseline were also calculated to identify the amount of change exceeding measurement error.31 42Given that SEM is calculated using reliability thresholds of 0.75, Cronbach\u2019s alpha at baseline was used for measures with \u2265three items and kappa coefficients based on inter-rater reliability were used for clinician assessments with <three items. Multiple meaningful change estimates were produced from the anchor-based and distribution-based methods and triangulated as per recommendations in the literature,31 34forming a recommended threshold for RDs.43Estimates were presented on a forest plot to identify convergence around a small range of values. Anchor\u2010based estimates were given primary consideration and distribution\u2010based methods were considered supplementary.34A weighted average was also calculated to produce a single threshold across anchors (Mweighted).43 ROC curves were used to estimate cut-off points for symptom severity for ESSPRI scores. Specifically, the ESSPRI score that defined between the lowest (group 1) and middle (group 2) severity groups, and the ESSPRI score that defined between the middle (group 2) and highest (group 3) severity groups were identified. Group definitions were informed by definitions used in previous studies (table 1). AUC (approximately >0.70), specificity and sensitivity were used to determine anchor appropriateness. To aid interpretation, boxplots displaying the spread of ESSPRI scores for the three severity groups were produced and superimposed with a scatter plot of patient responses and reference lines indicating the range of potential appropriate thresholds.

Q Q Q We followed a two-stage procedure to deal with heterogeneity, if present. In the first stage, we attempted to create mutually exclusive sets of studies that were relatively homogeneous. We grouped studies based on study design (RCT, retrospective study, RCT\u2009+\u2009OLE, prospective cohort study, registry, open-label trial) and follow-up length (\u2264\u200918\u00a0weeks; 19\u201338\u00a0weeks; 39\u201360\u00a0weeks) (see Supplement 8 for details) and assessed the level of heterogeneity separately for each subgroup. In the second stage, a multivariate meta-regression was used to further identify factors that significantly moderated the observed heterogeneity. A common pitfall of meta-regression is the use of a small number of studies per examined covariate [27]. The Cochrane handbook suggests a minimum of ten studies per covariate [28]. For our multivariate meta-regression model, we first identified potential moderators from the literature (see Supplement 9 for details). Then, all of these features that were reported by at least ten studies were included in the model. Moderator analysis using multivariate meta-regression was performed only for RCT studies as the number of studies per subgroup was below ten for other study designs. In comparison, the multivariate meta-regression model was also fitted for alternative grouping of studies, separately for each study design (results see Supplement 10). We also created two composite features ourselves. The included studies used a selection of ten different disease activity indices (see above). Each study reported at least two of these indices, however, the specific indices that were used varied greatly across studies. A composite disease activity was computed by scaling each disease activity index using each index\u2019s minimum and maximum values and then taking the mean of the scaled values (details in Supplement 11). Out of all utilized exclusion criteria, we identified 14 unique ones that all studies used in varying combinations. To overcome this, we created a second composite variable: the summed number of exclusion criteria used in each study (details in Supplement 12). In the case reports database, patient characteristics, infection location and micro-organisms were analyzed using descriptive statistics.",

    "23426": "Before statistical analyses, the distribution of all variables was visually inspected and checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk tests. All non-normal variables were log transformed. We first assessed the associations between SDB parameters and MTL subregions according to amyloid status by performing multivariable linear regressions with the volume of each MTL subregion as dependent variables and SDB parameters and amyloid status as independent variables, with age, sex, education, and the ApoE4 status as covariates. Separate models were conducted for each MTL subregion and each SDB parameter, and an interaction term was added between SDB parameters and amyloid status. When the interaction was significant, post hoc partial correlations were conducted separately in amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative individuals. Adding the body mass index as a covariate in regression models did not change the results, so it was not included in the final model to avoid statistical overfitting. Then, we investigated the links between SDB parameters and SDB-associated MTL regions and episodic memory performance at baseline and follow-up. We thus performed partial correlations between SDB parameters and/or MTL subregion volumes and both the log-transformed short-term and long-term free recalls of the CVLT at the 2 time points, controlling for age, sex, education, ApoE4 status, and the intervention group for longitudinal analyses. These analyses were performed in the whole cohort and in subgroups stratified by amyloid status. Of note, CVLT scores at follow-up (i.e., performed after the interventions) did not statistically differ between the passive control, English-learning, and meditation groups (eFigure 1,links.lww.com/WNL/C821). Finally, we performed several sensitivity and specificity analyses to ensure the robustness of our results. First, we replicated multiple regression analyses between SDB parameters and MTL subregion volumes derived from T1-weighted images, rather than high-resolution MRI sequences. We also checked whether our results were affected by laterality by replicating partial correlations between SDB severity parameters and left and right MTL volumes separately, rather than bilateral volumes, in amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative participants, controlling for age, sex, education, and ApoE4 status. Second, to evaluate the specificity of our main results (i.e., to verify whether the links between SDB and atrophy were restricted or not to MTL subregions), we performed voxel-wise multivariable regressions between SDB parameters and GM volume, controlling for the same covariates, using ap< 0.005 (uncorrected) threshold combined withp< 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) cluster-level threshold. p p Third, we investigated the influence of sex on our results by conducting partial correlations between SDB parameters and MTL subregion volumes in sex-stratified subgroups (in the whole sample and subgroups separated according to amyloid status), controlling for age, education, and the ApoE4 status. Finally, to verify whether the associations between sleep apnea severity and MTL integrity were mediated by alterations in sleep architecture (e.g., reduced deep sleep and increased lighter sleep and nocturnal awakenings), we assessed the associations between sleep architecture variables and both (1) SDB parameters and (2) MTL subregion volumes, controlling for age, sex, education, and the ApoE4 status. In case of significant associations, mediation analyses were conducted to confirm the mediating role of sleep architecture.

To investigate longitudinal age effects, we used a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM,[28]) approach to estimate the age trajectories of SA and TH without assuming a particular shape of the trajectories. To define the breakpoint-age at which thickness started the decline in this sample, a model with thickness as a piecewise linear function of age was applied, where the first line is set to be horizontal and the slope of the second line is estimated from data after the breakpoint. The breakpoint was chosen such that the piecewise model explained most variance of the estimated GAMM-smooth. For the investigation of longitudinal Change-Change associations between the various cognitive domains and SA/TH, we used Bivariate Latent Change Score (BLCS) models[12]. The BLCS models were used for two- and three test wave data, employing full-information maximum likelihood estimation for utilizing information from subjects with missing data at one or two test wave(-s), under the assumption that the missing data mechanism is Missing-at-random (MAR,[13]). For the 3-wave BLCS models, we investigated models with and without an invariance restriction on the change-change covariances across timepoints, where the restriction is that they are set to be equal across timepoints. As the restricted model is nested within the non-restricted, we could use a standard Likelihood Ratio Test for model comparison (cf.,[12]). Principal Component Analysis (PCA;[9]) was used to identify a general cognition/SA/TH score. Separate PCAs were done on the first test wave-data for: (i) the four cognitive tests, (ii) SAs in the three cortical ROIs, and (iii) THs in the three cortical ROIs (rostral middle frontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal cortex). Next, the obtained loadings for the first PC were used to calculate scores for the first PC across all test waves.

    "30042": "To quantify transendothelial migration rates, the definition of the analysis parameters must be carefully adjusted. This section describes the different steps to achieve this correctly. The segmentation parameters must be set in each laboratory and for each type of experiment as they are highly dependent on the fluorescent cell line used and other conditions. These parameters can be recorded for reuse in subsequent experiments; once set up, the experiment is highly reproducible. Perfect detection of THP-1 should not be sought, as it is impossible to achieve in real conditions with the tools and equipment available. One reason for this is that the fluorescence intensities vary from cell to cell in the culture of the fluorescent THP-1 line, ranging from high-intensity to almost imperceptible fluorescence (Figure\u00a04), although this line is cloned from a cell sorted by FACS based on its ability to emit high fluorescence intensity.1Figure\u00a04The fluorescence intensity of mKate2-N THP-1 cells varies from cell to cellThis figure shows a representative image of mKate2-N THP-1 cells grown in 6-well plates obtained by scanning in the red fluorescence channel using an exposure time of 800\u00a0ms with the IncuCyte\u00ae imaging system. Although a clone was obtained from a transduced cell (see Ladaigue et\u00a0al.1), variations in fluorescence intensity from one cell to another are observed (left panel). However, the segmentation parameters of the Incucyte\u00ae S3 allow the detection of all cells present in the microscopy field, as shown in the right panel which presents the same image as in the left panel after segmentation (segmented mKate2-N THP-1 cells are circled in blue). Scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm. The fluorescence intensity of mKate2-N THP-1 cells varies from cell to cell This figure shows a representative image of mKate2-N THP-1 cells grown in 6-well plates obtained by scanning in the red fluorescence channel using an exposure time of 800\u00a0ms with the IncuCyte\u00ae imaging system. Although a clone was obtained from a transduced cell (see Ladaigue et\u00a0al.1), variations in fluorescence intensity from one cell to another are observed (left panel). However, the segmentation parameters of the Incucyte\u00ae S3 allow the detection of all cells present in the microscopy field, as shown in the right panel which presents the same image as in the left panel after segmentation (segmented mKate2-N THP-1 cells are circled in blue). Scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm. To set segmentation parameters, it is first necessary to determine the parameters that minimize the detection of false positives. Then, if possible, the parameters that allow for maximum detection of THP-1 are determined. It is not very important that not all THP-1 are detected, as we are looking for relative comparisons. However, it is obviously important that the detection is homogeneous between\u00a0the wells and the different plates. Quantification of the transendothelial migration rate is performed after segmentation and filtration of fluorescent objects. Below, we describe the basic principles we use for this step, based on Sartorius\u2019 recommendations and our own experience. To establish a new analysis definition, we recommend the following step-by-step procedure.1.Open an experiment (vessel), launch the analysis, choose \u201cCreate a new analysis definition\u201d and \u201cChemotaxis migration (Top/Bot)\u201d as analysis type, and select at least the Red channel.2.At the step of image set selection, we recommend choosing only one image at one time point in which monocytes that have transmigrated are seen but not in too large numbers. This image should be representative of the overall images after several images are viewed and at several analysis time points.Note:We usually choose a scan performed around 24\u00a0h after transmigration initialization. At this time, the plateau has not yet been reached and THP-1 cells have not yet begun to multiply significantly in the upper compartment, an effect that could render the assay definition parameters inaccurate due to excessive fluorescence.3.Adjusted the settings n the \u201cRed bottom\u201d image channel chosen in the Layers menu.4.Segmentation.Note:As described for the interface of the IncuCyte\u00ae software, a Seed-and-Grow technique is used to mask the cells from the background (Figure\u00a05A). This technique uses two thresholds, the Seed Threshold and the Grow Threshold.a.Select the Seed Threshold first.b.Start with a Red Calibrated Unit (RCU) of the objects at 0 (default).c.Launch a preview.d.Use the mouse pointer to open the tooltip to evaluate the RCU of the non-segmented red objects or the wrongly segmented objects (Figure\u00a05A, image on top right).e.Change the Seed Threshold value to reflect the estimation by the mouse pointer and launch a preview.f.Repeat steps d\u2013e until as many objects as possible are correctly detected.g.Set the Grow Threshold value until a satisfactory segmentation is obtained.h.Finally, adjust the Edge Sensitivity value to split different objects that would otherwise be one object (Figure\u00a05B).Figure\u00a05Establishing a new analysis definition: segmentation, clean-up, and filtering(A) The analysis definition interface (left side of the left image) is first used to determine the segmentation parameters using a Seed-and-Grow technique (see on the figure the description given by the software through the tooltip system). The information indicated by the tooltip when the mouse pointer hovers over a fluorescent THP-1 cell (image on top right) is used to adjust the Seed Threshold level (in RCU units). By making several adjustments to the Seed Threshold, a satisfactory result can be achieved.(B) The segmentation is refined by determining parameters that allow separating the objects that need to be separated with the Edge Split tool. An example of the effectiveness of this tool is shown in the two images on the right.(C) Cleanup parameters are used to improve the segmentation masks. An example of the effect of the Adjust Size (Pixels) parameter is shown in the two images on the right.(D) Once segmented, the objects can be filtered using the four parameters proposed by the software interface, namely the Area, the Eccentricity, the Mean Intensity, and the Integrated Intensity.5.Clean up.IncuCyte\u00ae software offers the ability to fill the holes that may have been left in the objects (Holl Fill (\u03bcm2)), as well as to adjust the size of the objects (Adjust Size (pixels)) to the actual fluorescence area visualized (Figure\u00a05C). At this stage of the analysis definition, these parameters do not change the number of detected objects but allow a better visualization and a more accurate quantification of the fluorescence intensity of the segmented objects. For the quantification of transmigration rates, based only on the number of objects, these parameters have no impact.6.Filter.Once segmented, objects can be selected using 4 filters based on area, eccentricity(i.e., shape), mean intensity and integrated intensity. For each of these filters, minimum, maximum, or both values can be defined (Figure\u00a05D). The parameter values of each object can be visualized by means of the mouse pointer to open the tooltip on the setting image. The use of filters obviously changes the number of detected objects.7.Select scan times and wells to consider, and save and apply analysis definition to create the analysis.Note:We found high reproducibility of object size, fluorescence, and signal-to-noise ratio across experiments, allowing the same analysis definition parameters to be used for the different experiments. As already mentioned, however, it is necessary to verify that the segmentation is satisfactory after the analysis is complete.8.Statistical analysis.The IncuCyte\u00ae software includes a graph builder and a graph viewer that allows visualizing the curves of the number of detected objects for the different conditions versus time. This allows generating two types of graphs, one to visualize the values of each well as a function of time (Microplate\u00a0Graph) and the other to visualize the means and standard deviations in each condition as a function of time (Graph) (Figure\u00a06). The graphs of mean values versus time are useful to track the experiment in real time, provided that the analysis is performed at the end of each scan (reuse of a saved analysis definition). They are also useful to quickly visualize the results after all scans have been analyzed. The Microplate Graph is used to visualize the data from each well and to identify data from the wells (i.e., technical replicates) that should be excluded from the analysis due to technical problems. Statistical tests and graphical representation of data for publications are done in statistical analysis software such as GraphPad Prism after exporting data from IncuCyte\u00ae software.a.Number of technical replicates.The curves are highly similar from well to well (see, for example,Figure\u00a06, Microplate Graph); we nevertheless recommend n\u00a0= 6\u20138 technical replicates per condition of interest. This large number of replicates is permitted using 96-well plates. If wells need to be excluded from the analysis, this allows sufficient data to be retained for statistical analysis. For basic controls whose data are not involved in the quantitative analysis, such as wells without THP-1 or wells without chemoattractant, n\u00a0= 4 technical replicates are sufficient.b.Criteria for data inclusion/exclusion.The Microplate Graph Viewer can be used to identify wells where a technical problem has occurred and interfered with the normal course of transendothelial migration. These problems occur at a very low frequency. They may be due to design flaws in the membrane (very rare), extremely rarely impurities in the well (introduced by the experimenter or the culture medium), defects in the endothelial cell monolayer (e.g., due to growth problems or damage caused by the experimenter during handling), experimenter errors (such as forgetting to add the THP-1 cells or the treatment product), or problems during scan acquisition (troubleshooting). Most of the problems mentioned here can be avoided by good laboratory practices but there are other issues that cannot be avoided, such as defects in the membranes or errors made by the device during scans.Figure\u00a07gives some examples of technical problems and the visualization of the data that help to identify them (see also thetroubleshootingsection). Scans that are identified as incorrect due to proven technical problems are excluded from the analysis.Figure\u00a07Main technical problems identified by the analysis of scans and dataThis figure shows the most frequently encountered problems. The two main causes of technical problems are human causes (e.g., cell seeding errors, damage to the membrane or endothelial cell layer) or IncuCyte\u00ae scanning errors. In general, these problems are rare, and most of the time it is sufficient to exclude data from one or a few wells at some or all time points.(A) In this experiment, there are 8 technical replicates per condition arranged in the 8 wells of each column. The Microplate Graph shows an atypical curve of THP-1 count versus time in well B1 (circled in red) compared to other replicates. In this well, the scan shows that the endothelial cell monolayer is poorly formed (non-confluent cells) due to an unidentified problem, such as a seeding error or a defective membrane. The best solution is to exclude the data from this well.(B) In this experiment, there are 6 technical replicates per condition arranged in the rows. The Microplate Graph shows heterogeneous curves of THP-1 count versus time in wells A7-12 and B7-12 (circled in red). In two of these wells, scans show that there are no THP-1 cells. More generally, it appears that there was a problem with the distribution of THP-1 cells at the time of seeding. Here, the best solution is to repeat the experiment.(C) In this experiment, there are 4 technical replicates per condition arranged in the columns. The Microplate Graph shows problems in the THP-1 number versus time profiles in wells A4 and A5 (circled in red). The scans reveal a problem with the scan acquisition for these wells. Excluding data from these wells improves the plots of mean THP-1 counts versus time, as shown in the bottom graphs. Data are represented as mean\u00a0+/\u2212\u00a0SD derived from n\u00a0= 4 technical replicates.(D) An example of a scan acquisition problem for a well (circled in red), for some unknown reason. Here it is sufficient to exclude the data from this replicate.(E) Sometimes only one scan fails. In this experiment, there are 8 technical replicates per condition arranged in the 8 wells of the columns. The microplate graph shows atypical THP-1 counts at specific time points in wells B9 and C1 (circled in red). In these wells, the scans display an error in the acquisition of a part of the membrane area (framed in red). The best solution is to exclude the data from these time points.c.Graphical representation of data and statistical analysis.Data exported in .csv format are opened in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to organize them, then pasted into statistical analysis software such as GraphPad Prism to build graphs and perform statistical tests.The most useful graphs present curves of the average number of THP-1 objects as a function of time (Figures\u00a03A and 3B), as well as individual values of the number of THP-1 objects at given times after transendothelial migration initialization in scatter plots with bar (Figure\u00a03C).To find out whether the means of the conditions differ statistically, classical parametric (ANOVA) or non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis test) statistical tests with correction for multiple comparisons are performed at different times, e.g., at 24, 48, and 72 h.Figure\u00a06Create graphs with the IncuCyte\u00ae softwareThe IncuCyte\u00ae software includes a graph builder and a graph viewer that allows visualizing the curves of the number of detected objects for the different conditions versus time. This allows generating two types of graphs, one to visualize the values of each well as a function of time (Microplate Graph), and the other to visualize the means and standard deviations in each condition as a function of time (Graph).

Main technical problems identified by the analysis of scans and data This figure shows the most frequently encountered problems. The two main causes of technical problems are human causes (e.g., cell seeding errors, damage to the membrane or endothelial cell layer) or IncuCyte\u00ae scanning errors.

Graphical representation of data and statistical analysis. Data exported in .csv format are opened in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to organize them, then pasted into statistical analysis software such as GraphPad Prism to build graphs and perform statistical tests. The most useful graphs present curves of the average number of THP-1 objects as a function of time (Figures\u00a03A and 3B), as well as individual values of the number of THP-1 objects at given times after transendothelial migration initialization in scatter plots with bar (Figure\u00a03C). To find out whether the means of the conditions differ statistically, classical parametric (ANOVA) or non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis test) statistical tests with correction for multiple comparisons are performed at different times, e.g., at 24, 48, and 72 h. Create graphs with the IncuCyte\u00ae software The IncuCyte\u00ae software includes a graph builder and a graph viewer that allows visualizing the curves of the number of detected objects for the different conditions versus time. This allows generating two types of graphs, one to visualize the values of each well as a function of time (Microplate Graph), and the other to visualize the means and standard deviations in each condition as a function of time (Graph). In this experiment, there are 12 experimental conditions, with 8 technical replicates per condition arranged in the 8 wells of columns 1 to 12. The graphs of mean values versus time are useful to track the experiment in real time or to quickly visualize the results after all scans have been analyzed. The Microplate Graph is used to visualize the data from each well and to identify data from the wells(i.e., technical replicates) that should be excluded from the analysis due to technical problems. In the graph, data are represented as mean\u00a0+/\u2212\u00a0SD derived from n\u00a0= 8 technical replicates. (",

Bonferroni correction was performed for pairwise comparisons of the three groups. Binary data, such as sex, were compared using the chi\u2010square test. Statistical analyses of hippocampal subfields connectivity were performed using the DPABI toolbox (Yan et al.,2016). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with age, sex, education, and head motion (FD value) as covariates to determine FC alterations in hippocampal subfields between the three groups. To control for the effect of cortical atrophy on functional analysis, normalized modulated (with the volumetric information encoded) GM maps were used as covariate images. After Gaussian random field (GRF) correction, the threshold was set top<\u20090.005 at the voxel level andp<\u20090.05 at the cluster level. In addition, we extracted mean FC values from regions showing significant group effects by ANCOVA and further performed post\u2010hoc pairwise comparisons (p<\u20090.05, Bonferroni correction).

The effect index following the one-day Epi-school could not be calculated for three PWE and five relatives, but their data was included in the GLMM analysis. We included the intervention period (pre-post) as a fixed effect and gender and age as covariates, which were adjusted in the analysis. In the analysis of relatives, gender was the sole covariate utilized due to the absence of age information from two individuals, thereby rendering their inclusion in the covariate infeasible. The significance level was set at 5%. Furthermore, the effect size (Cohen's d) was calculated, and the standard was set to small (0.20\u20130.49), medium (0.50\u20130.79), and large (\u22650.80) [36].

For these analyses, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (two-tailed) was considered significant. Brain metabolite levels were expressed as ratios over the local CR concentration. Brain temperatures below 35.0\u00a0\u00b0C and above 42.0\u00a0\u00b0C were excluded as an additional data quality control measure, as temperatures outside of this range are not physiological. Mixed analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted with time as the within-subjects factor (levels: pre-endotoxin, post-endotoxin) and study group as the between-subject factor (levels: FM, HCs). Endotoxin dose (0.4\u00a0ng/kg vs 0.3\u00a0ng/kg) and its interaction with time were added as additional between-subjects factors, and age and the age-by-time interaction were entered as covariates of no interest. The effects of interest were the time-by-group interaction (to test whether FM and HC participants exhibited different responses to endotoxin) and the dose-by-time interaction (to test whether participants receiving 0.3\u00a0ng/kg (FM: N\u00a0=\u00a05; HC: N\u00a0=\u00a06) versus 0.4\u00a0ng/kg (FM: N\u00a0=\u00a07; HC: N\u00a0=\u00a07) endotoxin exhibited different responses).

The data analysis was conducted by using the software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.043as well as AMOS 26 for the structural equation modeling (SEM) in confirmatory factor analysis.44 Categorical data such as age groups, gender, body mass index (BMI) categories, marital status, religion, type of cancer, stage of cancer, education level, employment status, occupation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, treatment completed, and comorbidity are presented as count and percentages. Continuous data such as age in years are presented in mean and standard deviation (SD). The number of months since completion of anticancer treatment, and number of months of having comorbidity are presented in median and interquartile range (IQR). The acceptability outcomes are presented in descriptive statistics. Acceptability was assessed by measuring the data completion rate and the time spent to complete the QOLCSV-C. Additionally, feedback from the participants was gathered through open-ended questions regarding whether (1) the questionnaire accurately reflected their QoL, (2) the questionnaire was easy to fill out, (3) any items were difficult to understand or too sensitive to answer, (4) the length of the questionnaire was appropriate, (5) the font size of the questionnaire was appropriate, and\u00a0(6) they had any suggestions for improvement. Any answers to open-ended questions were recorded. The scale reliability of QOLCSV-C is presented in terms of internal consistency, item-total and item-subtotal correlations, and split-half reliability. A Cronbach's alpha \u2265 0.8 indicates an adequate internal consistency and demonstrates strong relationships among the items of the instrument.45In addition, the items' correlations with its corresponding subscale, other subscales, and the global scale of QOLCSV-C were computed by Spearman's correlation analysis. A correlation coefficient \u2265 0.4 is considered adequate.46The split-half reliability (Spearman\u2013Brown coefficient and Guttman coefficient) were computed on data halves by splitting the items according to odd and even numbers. The concurrent validity of QOLCSV-C was examined by calculating its correlations with FACT-G and between their subscales. Normality tests revealed normal distributions of QOLCSV-C's total and subtotals, but normal distribution was not evident in FACT-G score. Hence, nonparametric correlation analysis, that is, Spearman's correlations were conducted. The correlation coefficient with an absolute value between 0.4 and 0.7 suggests a moderate correlation, and a value > 0.7 indicates a strong correlation.47 Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to explore the number of factors explaining the items as well as the factor structure. The factorability of correlation matrix was tested by computing the KMO value and Bartlett's test. A KMO index larger than 0.6 and a significant Bartlett's test result support the suitability of factor analysis.48In EFA, the technique employed for extracting factors was Principal Axis\u00a0Factoring, while the rotation method was Oblimin with Kaiser normalization. The number of factors was determined by recognizing the elbow in the scree plot plotting the factor number against eigenvalue. Pattern matrix of loadings was reported. Items with Hoffman's complexity index49> 1.5 were excluded from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In CFA, the estimation method was maximum likelihood. A SEM plot was generated to report the standardized solution, and the squared multiple correlations. The covariances between errors terms belonging to the same factor were identified and modeled based on the modification indices. The cutoff of incremental fit index (IFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker\u2013Lewis index (TLI) were set at > 0.9; and the cutoff of root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was < 0.08, which indicate good model fit50,51,52. The sample size for EFA and CFA was 205. Floor and ceiling effects on the items of QOLCSV-C were counted and calculated in term of the percentage of individuals who have given either the lowest score (0) or the highest score (10) for an item. The percentages of individuals who acquired a zero in the total score or the full mark on the QOLCSV-C were computed also. The cutoff of the percentage was set at 15%40above which a floor or ceiling effect might have impact on the item's capability in discriminating between the individuals. We investigated the discriminant performance of several selected variables which could demonstrate significant difference in the QoL among cancer survivors as measured by the QOLCSV-C. The variables are identified from the literature, which suggests that education levels,53,54cancer treatment protocols,55BMI,55physical symptoms,56,57family income,53and employment status54,58are the associated factors affecting QoL of cancer survivors.

    "31122": "Maximum intensity projections (MIPs) were generated from each acquired z-stack. Gastruloids were automatically segmented from the DAPI channel using a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) on manually curated threshold-based segmentation masks. The network was based on a RDCNet backbone with a single class segmentation head and was trained in TensorFlow, using a soft-Jaccard loss.84Most wells contained a single gastruloid and when more than one was present, only the largest one was considered for further analysis. The medial axis skeleton was computed from the gastruloid mask (set of all points having more than one closest point on the object's boundary, i.e. ridges of the distance transform). To avoid small spurious branches, the distance transform was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel prior to extracting the ridges. Large, curled gastruloids were split along their folding line by subtracting a separator map from the distance transform prior to extracting the ridges. In case of the gastruloid screen analysis, the separator map was predicted from all four channels (DAPI, Sox1, Bra and E-cadherin) by a second FCN trained on manual annotations using a mean squared error loss. A regular rectangular grid was deformed to the shape of the mask and was used to measure its length/width as well as measure intensity profile along its length. First, gastruloid's \u201ccorners\" were determined by extrapolating the skeleton until the object boundaries. For skeletons with side branches, the two ends resulting in the longest path were used. Points along the contour that are equidistant from the ends of the original and extrapolated skeletons were used as corners. Equidistant points were placed along the contour between each corner, to define a mapping for the edges of a regular grid. The rest of the grid was mapped by thin plate interpolation. Finally, the grid orientation along the length of the gastruloid was normalised so that the mean intensity of the Bra channel over the second half of the grid was always larger than over the first half. Precipitates from the clearing solutions sometimes partially occluded the optical path, resulting in shaded regions. A shading mask was estimated by re-thresholding the DAPI channel at 30% of the difference between background intensity (10thpercentile over background) and the object intensity (90thpercentile over foreground). Shaded areas were excluded from intensity measurements and samples with more than 20% of their area shaded were completely discarded. On occasions, debris from the liquid dispenser ended up in the wells, resulting in bright fluorescent debris with very distinctive shape and texture. Binary masks of those debris were predicted by a FCN trained on manual annotations. Similarly to shading occlusions, affected regions were excluded from intensity measurements. For each segmented gastruloids, a set of morphological and intensity-based features were extracted from MIPs. Intensity features (mean, standard deviation, quantiles) were computed on image (for quality control), gastruloid, coarse and fine segment levels. Morphological features included perimeter, area, eccentricity, convexity, form factor, mean radius, length, and width, estimated from the mapped grid and number of skeleton branches. The grid mapped to the gastruloid was used to generate coarse (posterior/middle/anterior) and fine (100 steps) segments along its length. The anterior-posterior orientation was then determined by finding the centre of mass of either the Sox2 signal (corresponding to the anterior pole, used in the trajectory analysis) or the Bra signal (corresponding to the posterior pole, used in the screen analysis), see also \u201cGastruloid shape model\u201d. Hence, the intensity profile of the obtained line faithfully recapitulated the changes in readout intensity going from the anterior to posterior side of the gastruloid. Measured intensity values were normalised for each gastruloid by dividing the mean intensity of each segment over the sum of mean segment intensities of the gastruloid. In order to analyse markers localisation in the interior of the gastruloid, features were also extracted from the middle slice of the z-stack. The middle slice was taken as the z-plane having the largest mean intensity over the DAPI channel. The binary mask extracted from the MIP was also refined by re-thresholding the DAPI channel at 30% of the difference between background intensity (10th percentile over background) and the object intensity (90th percentile over foreground). To quantify radial signal localisation, the refined mask was partitioned into inside/outside regions with a separation at 50% of the maximum distance transform value. The in/out ratio represents the ratio of measured intensity between the two regions. For fine-graine localisation, the mask was partitioned into superpixels calculated with the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) method, initialised with uniform regions of approximately the size of a single cell (300 pixel). Superpixels were used as an approximation to single cells to determine (1) the localisation of the highest expressing superpixels and (2) the number of Sox2-high expressing cells. For the former, polar coordinates of superpixels were normalised by the maximum radius of the gastruloid. Superpixels were then ranked according to their mean intensity value and their angle normalised with respect to the mean angle of the 25% top-k pixels. Finally, a hexbin histogram of the top-k superpixels in normalised coordinates was built to represent a \u201cmean\u201d gastruloid at each timepoint and under different growth conditions. For the latter, the upper quartile of the mean intensity of superpixels of control gastruloids was used as threshold to distinguish Sox2 high and low values and the percentage of Sox2 high superpixels over total was calculated.

In/Out features: Inside area, Inside mean intensity, Outside area, Outside mean intensity. To align gastruloids according to their developmental states, we generated a pseudotime serving as the axis of molecular progression. For pseudotime inference we used Palantir32(python implementation, as included in the scanpy package), a trajectory inference algorithm originally developed for single cell sequencing and mass cytometry data. Trajectory inference comprised the following steps:1.z-score normalisation of the extracted features: Features were first normalised using z-score normalisation to reduce batch effect. Datapoints were grouped by experimental batches (2 in total). Subsequently, data was again z-score normalised whereby the 24h timepoint was used as reference.2.Quantile-based filtering of the input data: datapoints outside of the 0.2 percentile\u201399.8 percentile range for each of the 23 input features (common feature set) were discarded as outliers, pruning 303 objects.3.Pseudotime calculation: we considered gastruloid development as a stochastic process where gastruloids develop over time by a series of steps through a low dimensional phenotypic manifold. To this end, original 23-dimensional data was used to calculate 20 principal components that then served for calculating diffusion components, representing the dimension-reduced manifold.4.Iterative pseudotime construction: Random datapoints from 24h and 96h timepoints were selected as staring and terminal points of the trajectory, respectively. Pseudotime inference was based on 500 waypoints and performed for 100 iterations to generate an averaged pseudotime.5.Pseudotime resampling: Since pseudotime ordering is inferred from molecular events and depends on the features selected to describe them, large distances in feature space are captured by the inferred pseudotime, resulting in \u201cwarping\u201d of the pseudotime that can result in empty pseudotime intervals (Figure\u00a0S3). To address this issue, we resampled the pseudotime, removing intervals that lacked datapoints, thus obtaining a continuous trajectory. z-score normalisation of the extracted features: Features were first normalised using z-score normalisation to reduce batch effect. Datapoints were grouped by experimental batches (2 in total). Subsequently, data was again z-score normalised whereby the 24h timepoint was used as reference. Quantile-based filtering of the input data: datapoints outside of the 0.2 percentile\u201399.8 percentile range for each of the 23 input features (common feature set) were discarded as outliers, pruning 303 objects. Pseudotime calculation: we considered gastruloid development as a stochastic process where gastruloids develop over time by a series of steps through a low dimensional phenotypic manifold. To this end, original 23-dimensional data was used to calculate 20 principal components that then served for calculating diffusion components, representing the dimension-reduced manifold. Iterative pseudotime construction: Random datapoints from 24h and 96h timepoints were selected as staring and terminal points of the trajectory, respectively. Pseudotime inference was based on 500 waypoints and performed for 100 iterations to generate an averaged pseudotime. Pseudotime resampling: Since pseudotime ordering is inferred from molecular events and depends on the features selected to describe them, large distances in feature space are captured by the inferred pseudotime, resulting in \u201cwarping\u201d of the pseudotime that can result in empty pseudotime intervals (Figure\u00a0S3). To address this issue, we resampled the pseudotime, removing intervals that lacked datapoints, thus obtaining a continuous trajectory. Having aligned the individual gastruloids to the pseudotime-based developmental progression, we then assessed the dynamics of 21 antibody-based readouts (seekey resources table) along the pseudotime. To compensate for staining and imaging variation, we normalised the measured fluorescence intensity to that of the nuclear counterstain (DAPI). Mean values for each readout were then calculated for 11 bins of pseudotime (0 to 1, binned in 0.1 intervals) for visualising changes along the pseudotime. For assessing gradient dynamics along pseudotime, mean values for each segment were calculated per pseudotime interval (binning performed as described in previous section, for the intensity analysis in segments, see section \u201cSegment feature extraction\u201d). For image-based screening, conditions where fewer than 5 gastruloids from less than 3 individual plates were detected were discarded from the analysis, with the final dataset including 9311 gastruloids. In other assays, the threshold level for sparse conditions was assessed on an assay-to-assay basis. For the segment workflow, same quality control criteria have been applied, hence we started from 9157 gastruloids. Additional filters for the segment workflow included discarding all gastruloids that did not have signal in Channel 2 or 3 above baseline in any of the 100 segments per channel. Final object count for the segment analysis was thus 8724. In the gastruloid screening assay, extracted features were normalised using z-score normalisation within respective assay plates. Phenotypic clustering was carried out using the entire dataset (whole gastruloid and segment dataset used separately) using the software package PhenoGraph (python implementation; part of scanpy.external package). For the whole gastruloid features, the feature set defined inFigure\u00a0S4was used. For pattern class analysis, a 200-element array composed of the normalised Sox1 and Bra intensities of segments was used. Quality control was performed on the gastruloid area, fluorescent debris, and shading occlusions as described above. To determine the appropriate number of neighbours for the clustering, PhenoGraph analysis was performed for community sizes from 10 to 100 in increments of 10. Data was subsequently analysed and visualised using ClusTree,85an R package (https://github.com/lazappi/clustree) to select the optimal resolution for clustering. To incorporate the information on both the whole gastruloid and pattern phenotypes in all three treatment regimes, the abundance of both the whole gastruloid and pattern class types was calculated as fraction of total gastruloids measured for each screened condition. The resulting 57-element array was used to describe every condition in multivariate space and used for clustering by compound-level similarity, dimensionality reduction, and assessing DMSO similarity (Figures\u00a05andS5). DMSO similarity was defined\u00a0as the correlation coefficient of the 57-element phenotypic signature between the tested condition and that of the DMSO control. To non-ambiguously annotate targets of the compound library with functional annotation terms, we first assigned the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms to the target genes of the compounds. To resolve remaining ambiguous annotations (for example, when well-defined classes of compounds such as PKC inhibitors were assigned to much broader annotation terms), custom annotation terms were introduced to improve interpretability of the analysis (Table\u00a0S7). Term-term interactions (kappa-scores) were then calculated for the canonical KEGG terms using the Cytoscape3 plugin ClueGO. Individual treatment conditions were ranked by reproducibility of the resulting phenotypic effect. To this end, we defined a reproducibility score (seeFigure\u00a0S5). In brief, the reproducibility score described how homogeneous the observed phenotype was and how\u00a0robustly it was observed in replicates of the same condition, penalising conditions with more pleiotropic phenotypes. Conditions\u00a0with\u00a0a reproducibility score of more than 1.0 and DMSO similarity (see previous section) below 0.5 were selected as hits of the screen. To visualise known interactions present in the STRING database, annotated target genes of the compounds were used as input network nodes and interactions with STRING combined score above 0.4 were retrieved as network edges. Genes co-annotated with functional annotation terms (Table\u00a0S7) were highlighted for visualisation. Genome sequence and transcript annotation was obtained from Gencode Mouse release M24 (GRCm38 primary assembly and annotation gtf file fromftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M24), and the coordinates of transcripts and introns were extracted using R (https://r-project.org, version 3.6) and the getFeatureRanges function from the eisaR package (version 0.9 available fromhttps://github.com/fmicompbio/eisaR/tree/bbd8787d7e4b87d158a276af0787226530867b88) with arguments featureType\u00a0= c(\"spliced\", \"intron\"), intronType\u00a0= \"separate\", flankLength\u00a0= 0, joinOverlappingIntrons\u00a0= FALSE. A transcript-to-gene map was created using the getTx2Gene function from eisaR, which links transcripts to genes, and introns to distinct genes for simultaneous quantification (see below). Sequences were extracted from the genome using extractTranscriptSeqs from the GenomicFeatures package (version 1.38.2, )86and indexed with Salmon (version 1.1.087) with arguments -k 23\u00a0\u2013gencode and using the genome as a decoy. Reads were then quantified using Salmon/Alevin (version 1.1.088) with parameters -l ISR --chromiumV3 and the transcript-to-gene map created above. Technical quality of single cell experiments, cell barcode identification and quantification were assessed using the Bioconductor package alevinQC (version 1.4.0, https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.alevinQC). Salmon/Alevin counts from all twelve timepoints were imported into R (version 4.0.2) using the tximeta package (version 1.6.389) and stored in a SingleCellExperiment container for downstream analysis. The number of detected genes per cell and the fraction of counts in genes encoded on the mitochondrion (chrM) were calculated using the addPerCellQC function from the scater package (version 1.16.290), and cells with more than 1800 detected genes and less than 10% mitochondrial counts were retained. Gms, mitochondrial, and ribosomal protein genes (genes associated with the GeneOntology term \"structural constituent of ribosome\", GO:0003735, based on the org.Mm.eg.db package, version 3.11.4) were removed, resulting in a final analysis set of 27027 genes and 71005 cells. For batch effect correction, cells were assigned to one of two respective batches, and SCTransform-based normalization and variance stabilization91were performed followed by unsupervised identification of anchors between pairs of datasets, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and integration92,93using Seurat (version 4.1.1). Clustering (Louvain clustering of a constructed KNN graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space) and visualization were then performed using Seurat (version 4.1.1). Gastruloid cells from each timepoint were clustered separately using Seurat. Cells from the Pijuan-Sala et\u00a0al.23mouse embryonic dataset and the corresponding cell type annotation were used as the target reference for the CAT22analysis. Raw counts for the gastruloid (for each timepoint separately) and embryonic datasets were normalised in scanpy94based on total counts with a target sum of 10000 transcripts/cells and then log transformed. The CAT analysis was performed on clusters for each timepoint separately to match the gastruloid clusters to cell types. We would like to note that we employ both manual and CAT analysis-based annotations. Our results of the CAT analysis are dependent on the in\u00a0vivo reference (Pijuan-Sala et\u00a0al.).23Thus, the CAT-annotations -obtained for the gastruloid cells can be affected by limitations and possible annotation inaccuracies of this in\u00a0vivo reference. For that reason, we invested major efforts to perform manual annotations and comparisons with additional datasets.15,27 The cells corresponding to a given cell type (gut, pre-somitic mesoderm or NMPs) were selected from the gastruloid and Pijuan-Sala et\u00a0al.23embryonic datasets and their raw gene expression counts were merged to form a single gene expression matrix. RaceID3 (version 0.2.3)95was then used for normalisation and filtering using the default parameters. The means of the normalised counts for the genes were calculated for each of the embryonic and gastruloid cell type populations. The means were then plotted in a scatter plot and a linear regression model was inferred using ggplot2 and ggpmisc packages. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the embryonic and gastruloid cell type populations using the means. For the integration of gastruloid and embryonic scRNA-seq datasets, single-cell trasncriptomes of gastruloid cells and embryonic cells were merged to create a single-gene expression matrix. Three batches were created. Gastruloid cells were assigned to one of two respective batches for batch effect correction and embryonic cells from Pijuan-Sala et\u00a0al.23were assigned to a third batch. SCTransform-based normalization and variance stabilization were then performed followed by CCA and integration using Seurat (version 4.1.1). Clustering and visualization were then performed on the integrated dataset using Seurat. Single-cell transcriptomes from the embryonic epiblast data of Cheng et\u00a0al.27(GSE109071) were clustered and visualized using Seurat. Epiblast subpopulations were annotated based on the original annotation from Cheng et\u00a0al.27 Differential gene expression analysis between cells from different origins (mouse embryo versus gastruloids) or timepoints was performed using the diffexpnb function from the RaceID3 package.95First, negative binomial distributions reflecting the gene expression variability within each subgroup were inferred on the basis of the background model for the expected transcript count variability computed by RaceID3. Using these distributions, a P-value for the observed difference in transcript counts between the two subgroups was calculated and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method as described.96 For the Cheng et\u00a0al.27embryonic epiblast dataset (GSE109071), cells were ordered in chronological order of the sampled timepoints, and cells from each timepoint were ordered in ascending order along the anterior-posterior axis based on the coordinates of the first t-SNE dimension, that is the cells\u2019x-axis coordinates from the t-SNE. Gastruloid epiblast cells and ectopic pluripotent cells were ordered in chronological order of the sampled timepoints. For the ectopic pluripotency population, the SOM was generated using the FateID package based on the chronological ordering of the timepoints95and the temporally variable genes inferred from the differential gene expression analysis as described above. Only genes with more than two counts after size normalization in at least 10 cells were included for the SOM analysis. In brief, smooth profiles were derived by applying local regression on normalized transcript counts after ordering cells. A one-dimensional SOM with 144 nodes was computed on these profiles afterz-transformation. Neighbouring nodes were merged if the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of the average profiles of these nodes exceeded 0.85. The remaining aggregated nodes represent the gene modules shown in the SOM figures. x z After ordering cells, smooth temporal gene expression profiles were derived by applying local regression on normalized transcript counts using the FateID package. Gene signatures for the epiblast subpopulations (anterior, transitioning, and posterior) were assembled based on gene expression data from Cheng et\u00a0al.27 Alignment, processing, and counting of both ATAC and RNA molecules were performed using Cell Ranger ARC. The mouse mm10 genome was used a reference. For the scATAC-seq data, gene annotations were extracted from EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79. Cells from the 48h and 52h samples were filtered using total counts from both RNA and ATAC-seq datasets; cells that had greater than 1000 ATAC-seq counts/cells and 1000 transcript counts/cell were kept, resulting in a dataset of 1317 cells from the 48h sample and a dataset of 1096 cells from the 52h sample. The scATAC-seq data was normalized by performing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) normalization.97For the scRNA-seq data SCTransform-based normalization was performed in Seurat (version 4.1.1). Clustering of cells and visualization were performed using Seurat (version 4.1.1). For the scATAC-seq modality, after normalisation, top features were identified and partial singular value decomposition was applied; dimensionality reduction was performed using iterative latent semantic indexing followed by the generation of a UMAP on the first 50 dimensions from the iterative latent semantic indexing reduction while discarding the first dimension associated with sequencing depth variability. For the snRNA-seq modality, after normalisation, the UMAP was generated based on the first 50 dimensions from the PCA. Weighted nearest neighbor clustering was performed on RNA+ATAC-seq data in single cells. Visualizations for gene accessibility profiles were performed using Signac (version 1.9.0) and Seurat (version 4.1.1). For inferring gene activity in single cells, gene coordinates were extracted and then extended to include the 2 kb region upstream of the transcription start site (region containing the promoter). The number of fragments for each cell that map to each of these regions were counted and aggregated. Gene activities were then log normalized using the median total count of gene activities as a scale factor. Gene activities were inferred in single cells for single genes that belong to a particular cell type/state signature. The gene activities for genes belonging to a particular signature were then aggregated. The single-cell transcriptomes from the 52h multiome data were integrated with the single-cell transcriptomes of the ectopic pluripotency and primitive-streak like populations from the scRNA-seq data. Cells were assigned to one of three respective batches, and SCTransform-based normalization and variance stabilization91were performed followed by unsupervised identification of anchors between pairs of datasets, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and integration92,93using Seurat (version 4.1.1). FateID was used to infer the cell fate probabilities.95The ectopic pluripotency and primitive-streak like populations were assigned as the target states. After quantifying the cell fate probabilities or fate bias in single cells, the fate bias of the multiome clusters towards the ectopic pluripotency and primitive streak-like populations were quantified. Raw RNA-seq reads were trimmed to remove Nextera adapters or bad quality bases (Cutadapt v4.0 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -q 30 -m 15).98Mapping was done from filtered reads on the mouse genome mm10 with STAR version 2.7.8a99with the gencode.vM24.primary assembly annotations and ENCODE parameters. FPKM values were obtained by Cufflinks version 2.2.1100,101with options --no-effective-length-correction -b 'mm10.fa' --multiread-correct --library-type fr-firststrand --mask-file 'chrM_mm10.gtf' --max-bundle-length 10000000 --max-bundle-frags 1000000 (where chrM_mm10.gtf contains a transcript on each strand of the whole chrM). PCA, correlation matrices and clustering were performed on log2(1\u00a0+ FPKM) values of the 2000 most variant genes. Visualization was done in R v4.2.1, Heatmaps were generated with the Pheatmap package (v1.0.12) using log2(1\u00a0+ FPKM) values scaled for each gene. Samples were clustered using Pearson correlation from the visualized genes. No samples were excluded from the analysis. The sample correlation matrix was obtained using the 2000 most variable genes using the \"ward.D2\" clustering method on the spearman inter-sample correlations.",

Note that, while the pre-processing pipeline can readily detect SNVs, indels may be challenging to count accurately.a.In those cases, to get WT and mutant counts from single cells, you can apply the grep function in Unix directly to the FASTQ files, counting the number of WT and indel sequences observed in each file.i.If the indel is covered both by R1 and R2, grep the WT and mutant sequences from both FASTQ files. Note that, for R2, you need to provide the reverse complement sequences.ii.In those cases, the total WT and mutant coverage is given by the sum of reads from the R1 and R2 files.b.For specific indels, like FLT3-ITD, specialized pipelines12can be adapted.

Prior to the analysis, all variables were square root transformed to obtain normal distribution, and then normalised (for each variable, the mean was subtracted and divided by the standard deviation) in order to put variables on a common, dimensionless measurement scale.57,58In order to compare benthic and epiphytic communities, we calculated for each sample relative abundances as the number of individuals of a given taxon divided by the total number of individuals collected in the sample. The diversity of chironomid communities was measured using two standard diversity indices, species richness (S) and Shannon index (H\u2032). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to analyse and graphically present relations of chironomid communities in different locations within the floodplain, in sediment and on macrophytes. The same analysis was used to compare benthic and epiphytic Chironomidae. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was applied to identify the significance of differences between the locations and habitat types. Both methods were applied to the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix based on the square root transformed relative abundance data. The contribution of Chironomidae taxa to the average dissimilarity between groups was assessed using the similarity percentages breakdown (SIMPER) analysis. A multivariate ordination method, redundancy analysis (RDA), was performed using CANOCO for Windows version 4.5 software package59to analyse the potential influence of environmental parameters on benthic and epiphytic chironomid communities across different locations. RDA was suggested by the initially performed detrended correspondence analysis, as the value of the longest gradient was lower than 4.0.60To obtain a normal distribution, all data were square root transformed prior to RDA.

We excluded NICE milestone dates that came before FDA approval because there was no corresponding US RWD to consider. We counted the number of patients starting the new drug or regimen after FDA approval, estimated their corresponding potential follow-up time,11and calculated time-at-risk measured using person-time in person-years. Within any time interval after FDA approval, patients were followed from the date of first exposure to death, last EHR activity or the NICE milestone date, whichever came first. Given the variability in the time between FDA approval and NICE milestones for each TA, we also computed patient count rates (patient count/time) to standardise the period of patient accumulation after FDA approval. Count rates were calculated by taking the number of patients accumulated between FDA approval and the NICE milestone and dividing by the time (in months) between FDA approval and the NICE milestone. We summarised the measures of available EHR-derived RWD (ie, the patient counts, follow-up time, and the count rates (patient count/time)) using median and IQR at each NICE milestone.

It can rank attributes by their evaluations when evaluating the worth of an attribute by measuring the correlation (Pearson\u2019s) between it and the class. To avoid the curse of dimensionality and reduce the risk of overfitting, we compared the correlation coefficients (CC) between each attribute, removing the redundant attributes. To get better accuracy, we combined the clinical variables to build the prediction model. The weights of clinical variables are customized by clinical doctors according to CC and medical knowledge. To find a simple and effective model, we discretized the RF based on its frequency and combined the selected features whose weight came from logistic regression into one feature combination. Before the feature combination, we had to adjust the weight of each selected feature to get a better classification performance.

The EGFP-Rim4 variants autophagic degradation were calculated by free EGFP signals divided by total EGFP signals, including full length EGFP-Rim4 variants and the free EGFP signals. Phosphorylated EGFP-Rim4 (EGFP-Rim4-p) levels were calculated by EGFP-Rim4-p signal (detected by \u03b1-RRxS/T-p antibody) divided by EGFP-Rim4 signal (detected by \u03b1-EGFP antibody). The overall area volumes of the immunoblotting were analyzed by ImageJ (1.53u). Global background was subtracted by rolling ball method with radius of 50 pixels. The overall phosphorylation levels were calculated by the sum of the phosphorylation signal (detected by \u03b1-RRxS/T-p antibody) between 20 kDa and 150 kDa marker divided by the Ponceau S signal of the same blot, between 20 kDa and 150 kDa. Because of technical difficulties, the Ponceau S signals were not consistent between experiments, so for the analysis of each blot, the ratio between phosphorylation and Ponceau S signal was further normalized by one chosen reference group which was set as value 1.

Following correction for sequencing depth, the protein stability index (PSI) metric was calculated for each GFP-peptide fusion. The PSI score is given by the sum of multiplying the proportion of reads in each bin by the bin number (1-6 in this case), thus yielding a stability score between 1 (maximally unstable) and 6 (maximally unstable):PSI=\u2211i=16Ri\u2217i(whereirepresents the number of the bin and Rirepresents the proportion of Illumina reads present for a peptide in that given bini). Read counts and associated stability score for each GFP-peptide fusion are detailed inTable\u00a0S1. i i i A \u0394PSI score was generated for each GFP-peptide fusion reflecting the difference in raw PSI scores between untreated sample and MLN7243 or bortezomib treatment.

UbInPD Histograms presented inFigures\u00a02A,S1C, S1D,S2A,S5C, S5D,S6D, and S6E show the proportion of corrected count reads in each one of the bins for the indicated GFP-fusions. Stabilization by the indicated inhibitors is indicated by a sharp peak to the right side of each panel. Illumina reads were trimmed of constant regions derived from the backbone of the GPS expression vector using Cutadapt. The number of occurrences of each of the 24 nucleotide barcode sequences that remained was then quantified using Bowtie 2. In the majority of cases barcodes could be uniquely assigned to individual ORFs; however, in cases where a barcode could not distinguish between multiple isoforms of the same gene (indicated by a lower case \u2018ioh\u2019 identifier inTable\u00a0S3), read counts were assigned to all isoforms of that gene. After correcting for sequencing depth, the stability of each individual barcoded ORF was using the PSI metric, yielding a stability score between 1 (maximally unstable) and 4 (maximally stable). A \u0394PSI score was generated for each barcode reflecting the difference in raw PSI scores between untreated sample and MLN7243 or bortezomib treatment. Then, average of \u0394PSI score of all barcodes of a single ORF were calculated to obtain an ORF \u0394PSI. GFP-ORF fusions were defined asUbInPDsubstrates if they showed \u0394PSIbort\u22650.3 and \u0394PSIMLN\u22640.

To implement the Hochberg method, the p-values for the set of multiple null hypotheses are ordered from largest to smallest, and each p-value is compared to a sequentially decreasing alpha-level to determine whether the null hypothesis (and, potentially, subsequent hypotheses) should be rejected. Symbolically, for the set of p-values (p1, \u2026pk) ordered from largest to smallest and testing the corresponding set of null hypotheses (Ho1, \u2026Hok), the Hochberg procedure is implemented as.1.Evaluate whether p1<\u00a0\u03b1. If yes, reject Ho1and all subsequent null hypotheses (Ho2, \u2026Hok). Else, do not reject Ho1and go to Step 2.2.Evaluate whether p2<\u00a0\u03b1/2. If yes, reject Ho2and all subsequent null hypotheses (Ho3, \u2026Hok). Else, do not reject Ho2and go to Step 3.[\u2026]K.Evaluate whether pk<\u00a0\u03b1/k. If yes, reject Hok. Else, none of the null hypotheses (Ho1, \u2026Hok) are rejected and stop. Evaluate whether p1<\u00a0\u03b1. If yes, reject Ho1and all subsequent null hypotheses (Ho2, \u2026Hok). Else, do not reject Ho1and go to Step 2. Evaluate whether p2<\u00a0\u03b1/2. If yes, reject Ho2and all subsequent null hypotheses (Ho3, \u2026Hok). Else, do not reject Ho2and go to Step 3.

As only the smallest p-value is compared to the traditional Bonferroni-corrected \u03b1-level, the Hochberg method is more statistically powerful for controlling type I error in the context of testing multiple null hypotheses and better accounts for possible correlation among variables. Curve fit and statistical analyses of arousal threshold assay were carried out using non-linear regression [Agonist vs Response\u2014Variable slope (four parameters)].

In social preference studies, comparisons of the difference in SPI from baseline to post measurement and post value adjusted for baseline among genotypes were performed via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by pairwise comparisons, consistent with other analyses. As all models were controlled for baseline SPI, these two analyses provide entirely consistent results when comparing values between groups; thus, the conclusions of the two analyses are identical and are used simply to provide complementary data presentations.",

Briefly, Sparse Correlations for Compositional data were employed to determine the co-abundance (positive) and co-exclusion (negative) relationships among the 235 core species based on their relative abundances (Segata et al., 2011). The Ward clustering algorithm and PERMANOVA (999 permutations,P< 0.005) (Zhang et al., 2016) based on SparCC correlation coefficients were used to cluster the 235 core species into 8 co-abundance groups using the R program. To identify the different abundances between Chinese yellow quails and Japanese quails, LEfSe analysis were performed under the condition of \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05, with a linear discriminant analysis score of at least 2.0 (Segata et al., 2011).

    "30431": "Neural spiking data were time-locked to the onset of visual (display) stimulus. The main analysis epoch was from 100 to 400\u00a0ms after visual stimulus onset. The average firing rate was computed for the Target Present (TP) and Target Absent (TA) trials within the analysis epoch. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was quantified to measure the discriminability of TP and TA trials (referred to as target AUC). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to calculate the AUC\u2019s statistical significance for each neuron. The preferred value for each neuron was determined using a cross-validation technique.10 For the LFP analysis, data were down-sampled to 1 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 250\u00a0Hz. Line noise and its sub-harmonics were removed using notch filters. For each session, trials with an LFP amplitude range of 3 standard deviations from the median were identified as noisy trials and removed in pre-processing. All pre-processing steps were performed using EEGLAB (-v2022.0). The time-frequency analysis was performed using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and averaged over all frequencies of interest on each time sample. The CWT was obtained using an analytic Morse wavelet (Aguiar-Conraria\u00a0& Soares, 2011). In this study, four frequency bands were defined as Alpha (8\u201312\u00a0Hz), Beta (12\u201330\u00a0Hz), Low-Gamma (30\u201360\u00a0Hz), and High-Gamma (60\u2013200\u00a0Hz). In trial-power versus time plots (Figure\u00a05C), CWT results were smoothed across trials and time using median and mean averaging, respectively. LFP response duration is calculated using Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for each trial and correlated with the behavioral results (Figure\u00a05). To select visual responsive neurons, custom-written MATLAB functions were used as discussed before (Ghazizadeh\u00a0& Hikosaka, 2021, 2022; Ghazizadeh, Hong, et\u00a0al., 2018). Briefly, first, the average firing PSTH time-locked to display onset across all trials for each neuron was computed. Then, the computed firing rate was converted to z scores using the baseline from \u2212200 to 30\u00a0ms related to the display onset. Using MATLAB findpeaks, the first response peak after object onset was detected. The minimum peak height was 1.64, corresponding to the 95% confidence interval. The first valley before the first detected peak was taken as the visual onset of the neuron. This algorithm was also used to detect the onset of the target-signal by using the average value PSTH of each neuron. During the recording of each neuron, monkeys performed the search task one or two times. The neurons that had only one search task were called single-search neurons, and the neurons with two search tasks were called two-search neurons. For almost all two-search neurons, one search task was run with over-trained fractal sets and another with sufficiently-trained fractal sets. To quantify the efficiency of visual search, we computed the search slope for each session separately as the slope of the linear regression of search time as a function of set-size, using target present trials only. Sessions were then classified as either efficient or inefficient based on their search slope. Specifically, sessions with steeper slopes (i.e., higher search times for smaller set-sizes) were classified as inefficient, while sessions with shallower slopes (i.e., lower search times for smaller set-sizes) were classified as efficient. For one-search neurons, searches whose slope was less than percentile 40 of the search slope distribution were considered efficient sessions, and searches whose slope was higher than percentile 60 were considered inefficient sessions. For two-search neurons, if the difference of two search slopes was more 10ms per item (roughly matching with the search slope difference based on 40 and 60 percentiles), the search with a lower slope was considered efficient, and the other search was inefficient. This method of calculating search slope has been widely used in the literature and has been shown to be a reliable measure of search performance. Note that except for TP search slopes this definition of the two search types allows for independent analysis of the behavioral results on accuracy in TP and TA trials, the search time and slope in TA trials and the search time in TP trials. Mixed-design ANOVA test with one within-subject or fixed factor (set-size) and one between-subject or random factor (subject) was used to examine the significant effect of set-size on the behavioral and neural responses. Another Mixed-design ANOVA test with one within-subject factor (set-size) and two between-subject factors (search efficiency and subject) was used to investigate the effect of search efficiency, set-size and their interaction on the behavioral and neural responses.

For each animal, the coherence measured at each voxel was compared against a null distribution, of which the samples were the coherence between the randomly phase-shuffled EGG signal and the original fMRI signal. Phase shuffling of a signal kept the magnitude but altered the phase of its spectrum. As shown inFig. 2C, the phases of the recorded EGG signals were first shuffled in the frequency domain. Inverse Fourier transform was then used to create the phase-shuffled data. After the phase shuffling of EGG, their coherence with the fMRI signals was disrupted and reduced to a chance level subject to the same signal processing steps for evaluating either coherence or phase locking value (Fig. 2B). The phase-shuffling of EGG was performed 100 times to build the null distribution. The null distribution was separately built for each voxel, animal, and condition. The coherence between the original EGG and fMRI signals was compared to the null distribution and converted to a z score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the null distribution. To test for the significance in the group level, a one-sample t test was applied to voxel-wise z scores obtained from each group of animals (one-sidedp< 0.05 corrected with a cluster size greater than 10 voxels or 2.5 mm3). p The coherence with EGG was summarized with respect to anatomical regions of interest (ROIs).

We included 23 female\u2010specific health conditions to evaluate in this study, including breast cancer, which can affect both sexes but is far more prevalent in women than men. Large multiancestry GWASs are not available for most of these conditions. Therefore, we used PLINK (version 1.90) to conduct GWASs of female\u2010specific health conditions documented in the PMBB and eMERGE data sets.30We filtered the genetic variants in the PMBB and eMERGE imputed data sets to include only variants with imputation qualityR2>0.3 and minor allele frequency >0.01. We then conducted separate GWASs for European and African ancestry individuals in the 2 cohorts and combined results from the 2 cohorts using the meta\u2010analysis command in PLINK. R We used the GWASs obtained and generated above to calculate pairwise genetic correlations between cardiometabolic phenotypes and female\u2010specific health conditions using linkage disequilibrium score regression.31Linkage disequilibrium score accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs by using an external reference panel that should match the ancestry distribution of the corresponding GWASs. We generated European and African ancestry LD reference panels using the HapMap3 SNPs (\u22481 M common variants) from all members included in the respective 1000 Genomes population.32We then used these LD reference panels to calculate the genetic correlation separately in European and African ancestry participants. We then combined correlation results across ancestries through a meta\u2010analysis using the metafor R package under the restricted maximum likelihood model. PGSs calculated using a GWAS of 1 particular ancestry group tend to perform poorly when applied to individuals from a different ancestry group.20,33,34To accurately calculate PGSs for our diverse cohorts, we calculated PGSs for the cardiometabolic phenotypes using the same publicly available GWAS used in the genetic correlation analyses. Weights for each SNP were calculated using PRS\u2010CS (version from April 24, 2020), a method that performs Polygenic Prediction via Bayseian Regression and Continous Shrinkage Priors.35PRS\u2010CS requires a reference panel that matches the ancestry distribution of the target data set. We generated multiple reference panels for analyses: European\u2010only reference panel from 1000 Genomes European ancestry population, African\u2010only reference panel from 1000 Genomes African ancestry population, and a multiancestry LD reference panel using the HapMap SNPs from the entire 1000 Genomes populations (2504 individuals). We identified LD patterns within the 1000 Genomes population by using PLINK (version 1.90) to determine LD blocks and calculate the LD between the SNPs in each block. For PRS\u2010CS, the global shrinkage parameter \u03c6 was fixed to 0.01, and default values were selected for all other parameters. PGSs were then calculated using the weights with PLINK. Only the SNPs in the target data set, summary statistics, and LD reference panel were included in the PGSs. The numbers of SNPs used for each PGS calculation are listed in Table2. The scores were then normalized (mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) for each analysis separately (stratified by ancestry and overall). To evaluate the power of the PGSs, we tested their performance on association of the corresponding primary phenotypes in the summary statistics. We could not obtain quantitative measurements of blood pressure for all participants in the eMERGE cohort, and PP and SBP measurements were not curated in the PMBB cohort. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the PGSs for blood pressure traits (SBP, DBP, PP) in the eMERGE cohort based on hypertension case\u2013control phenotypes, and we evaluated the performance of the PGS blood pressure traits in the PMBB cohort based on DBP or hypertension (for SBP and PP) as outcomes. We constructed logistic regression models for binary phenotypes (CAD, T2D, and hypertension) and evaluated PGS performance by the area under the receiver operating curves using the pROC package in R. Similarly, we constructed linear regression models for continuous phenotypes (BMI and DBP) and evaluated them by theR2using the glm function in R. We also evaluated the value of including PGS in our models by using the likelihood ratio test to compare the null (covariate only) model with the full (PGS and covariates) model using the lmtest package in R. The regression models used birth year and the first 5 principal components (PCs) as covariates. PCs for PMBB and eMERGE were determined from projection onto the 1000 Genomes population. We tested PGS performance overall as well as for subgroups of European or African ancestry. In addition, we constructed European and African LD reference panels using individuals from the respective ancestry groups from 1000 Genomes and computed PGSs using these ancestry\u2010specific LD panels. We then compared the performance of the PGSs with the PGSs generated using the multiancestry LD reference panel in the PMBB cohort. R Cases and controls for each phenotype were defined usingInternational Classification of Diseases(ICD\u20109 and ICD\u201010) diagnosis codes. Participants were coded as cases of a given phenotype if their records contained at least 1 of the correspondingICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010codes. For pregnancy\u2010related phenotypes, participants were only considered controls if their records had at least 1 pregnancy\u2010relatedICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010code and noICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010codes for relevant complications (such as miscarriage) during pregnancy. Participants were counted as controls for cardiometabolic phenotypes and all non\u2013pregnancy\u2010related health conditions if their records did not contain any relevantICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010code. The complete list ofICD\u20109 and ICD\u201010codes used to include or exclude participants as cases and controls can be found in TableS1. Using these definitions, we determined the sample size for each phenotype in the eMERGE and PMBB cohorts (Table1). International Classification of Diseases ICD\u20109 and ICD\u201010 ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010 ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010 ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010 ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010 ICD\u20109 and ICD\u201010 We tested the association between each cardiometabolic PGS and female\u2010specific health condition by fitting separate logistic regression models adjusted by birth year and the first 5 PCs. We conducted this analysis for all participants and for subsets of participants of European or African ancestry. To account for biases from multiple hypothesis testing, we determined if associations passed a Benjamini\u2010Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) significance threshold of 0.05, adjusting thePvalues with the number of hypotheses tested (6 cardiometabolic PGSs\u00d723 female\u2010specific health conditions=138 hypotheses). The logistic regressions were performed using the glm function in R. The results from the PMBB and eMERGE cohorts were meta\u2010analyzed using the rma function from the metafor R package under the restricted maximum\u2010likelihood estimator model.36We used PheWAS\u2010View to visualize the results.37We then created prevalence plots for each significant association. The participants were divided into quintiles based on the PGS for each condition, and the percentage of cases was calculated for each quintile. P To identify evidence of causality between cardiometabolic phenotypes and female\u2010specific health conditions, we performed 1\u2010sample MR for 27 significant associations from the PGS analyses using the ivreg function in the ivpack R package and tested which relationships were significant after Benjamini\u2010Hochberg FDR correction (adjusting for 27 hypotheses). Cardiometabolic PGSs we calculated before were used as genetic instruments, because effect sizes for each SNP were adjusted according to the significance of the association through PRS\u2010CS. We also included birth year and the first 5 PCs as covariates. The results were then combined in a meta\u2010analysis using the metafor R package under the restricted maximum\u2010likelihood estimator model. Because the small sample size for some of the conditions could limit the power of the analysis, we also performed 2\u2010sample MR for the same associations using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method in the twoSampleMR package in R.38MR sensitivity analyses were conducted using the weighted median and MR Egger methods in the same package, and tests for horizontal pleiotropy were also performed using MR Egger. The genetic instruments for the cardiometabolic phenotypes in the 2\u2010sample MR were the genome\u2010wide significant SNPs (P<5\u00d710\u22128) in the respective cardiometabolic GWAS used to calculate the PGSs. The SNPs were pruned according to LD patterns among the 1000 Genomes HapMap SNPs (r2=0.1, kb=250), and the remaining representative SNPs were included in the analysis. Matching genetic instruments for the female\u2010specific health conditions were obtained from publicly available GWASs through the twoSampleMR package (TableS2). Bidirectional MR was also performed for female\u2010specific health conditions that had at least 1 genome\u2010wide significant SNP in the GWAS after pruning (r2=0.1, kb=250). Because these GWASs for female\u2010specific health conditions were conducted in only European ancestry populations, we performed 2\u2010sample MR for only associations that were significant in all participants or participants of European ancestry. Two\u2010sample MR results were then tested for significance after multiple hypothesis correction using an FDR threshold of 0.05 (adjusting for 13 unique significantly associated female\u2010specific health conditions). Genetic instrument strength for each analysis was calculated using the meanFstatistic (\u03b22/\u03c32) across all SNPs from the cardiometabolic GWASs included in the MR. P r r F We divided the participants into high\u2010risk and low\u2010risk groups according to each cardiometabolic PGS. High PGS was defined as the top quintile (>80th percentile), and low PGS was defined as the bottom quintile (<20th percentile). We considered age at the first occurrence of each female\u2010specific health condition from theICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010records. For pregnancy\u2010related conditions, the participants were split into 3 age groups: <25, 25 to 39, and 40 to 55 years. We excluded participants who were >55\u2009years of age at the first occurrence of a pregnancy\u2010related condition because of low sample sizes and potential errors in diagnosis coding. For all nonpregnancy related conditions, the participants were split into 5 age groups: <25, 25 to 39, 40 to 54, 55 to 69, and \u226570\u2009years. We then examined the combined case prevalence of each health condition within the high and low PGS groups in each cohort across all age groups. ICD\u20109 or ICD\u201010",

Prespecified hypotheses to document content validity (ie, the association between a measure and other criterion indicators that are believed to measure that same construct) and discriminant validity to establish the distinctness of each subscale (2,15) included the following:DOCGL would be correlated significantly with subglobals DOCINF, DOCDAM, DOCSTR.DOCINF would be correlated with SJC, ESR, and CRP at higher levels than with other measures.DOCDAM would be correlated with DJC and radiographic scores at higher levels than with other measures.DOCSTR would be correlated with MDHAQ FAST4 screening index for fibromyalgia (28,29), which agrees more than 90% with reference 2011 fibromyalgia criteria (30), and MDHAQ screening index MDS2 (31), which agrees 80% with PHQ\u20109 (32) and HADS\u2010D (33) (similar to agreement of the two reference indices with one another), at higher levels than with other measures.

Age, sex, and disease duration were included in the regressions as independent variables. The variable effect size was expressed as regression coefficients (B) with 95% confidence intervals. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to indicate the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables account for collectively.

The total number of macrophages is determined by the number of CellTracker Green-positive macrophages (Analysis A,Figure\u00a03) or the maximum number of DRAQ7-positive macrophages across the imaging time course (Analysis B,Figure\u00a03;Table\u00a01,Data S1).

    "7304": "To explore how stability changed over succession at larger and local scales, \u03b3 and \u03b1 stability were modeled, respectively, as functions of the initial sampling year of each 10-year window, using generalized least squares (GLS) regression. Similarly, we used linear and quadratic GLS models to assess how spatial asynchrony, species asynchrony, and species stability change over succession. To account for potential temporal autocorrelation in the time series residuals, we specified a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure in these GLS models. To examine whether and how the temporal change of stability was related to the change of diversity at both local and larger scales, we performed univariate linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) using the nlme package (76) in R. The LMMs modeled different temporal stability components, calculated over sequential 10-year rolling windows, as functions of the average diversity within each rolling window. Field was included as a random factor in all LMMs, and an AR1 correlation structure was used to account for temporal autocorrelation. Specifically, \u03b3 stability was fitted as a function of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional \u03b3 diversity measures, and spatial asynchrony was fitted as a function of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional \u03b2 diversity measures. The response variables were log10-transformed in LMMs to ensure the normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance. Similarity, \u03b1 stability, as well as species asynchrony and species stability, was fitted as functions of multiple facets of \u03b1 diversity (including Hill numbers, MPD, MPDab, MFD, and MFDab). Marginal and conditionalR2values of these univariate models were calculated using the MuMIn package (77), and the standardized coefficient of each variable was calculated and compared using the effectsize package (78) in R. 76 R 77 78 To further investigate the relative importance of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity measures on different stability components, we also fitted multivariate LMMs for each stability component. Before the regression analyses, we checked the correlation between diversity indices at the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 levels, respectively, to identify potential multicollinearity among diversity indices (fig. S15). Highly correlated diversity indices (here, Pearson\u2019sr> 0.7) were alternatively included in our multivariate models. The same random effect and autocorrelation structure were used for multivariate LMMs, and the model with the lowest corrected AIC was identified as the best-fitting model. For the best model, we assessed the variance inflation factor (VIF) to evaluate the risk of multicollinearity, ensuring that all selected predictors had VIF < 3. r In addition, we constructed a SEM to disentangle direct and indirect drivers of \u03b3 stability at the larger spatial scale, based on the a priori theoretical framework [fig. S12A; (18)]. Specifically, we examined how functional \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity (i.e., MFD and \u03b2MFD) directly and indirectly affected the different components of temporal stability, as functional diversity emerged as a superior predictor of stability components in our univariate and multivariate models (tables S1 and S2). To avoid potential confounding effects, we excluded the successional year from the a priori model due to its significant correlation with diversity throughout the succession. The SEM was fitted using LMMs with the field as the random effect and incorporating temporal autocorrelation structure in each model using the piecewiseSEM package (79). The global model fit was assessed via Fisher\u2019sCstatistic (P> 0.05), and Shipley\u2019s test ofd-separation was used to ensure that we did not miss any potential pathways. 18 79 C P d",
