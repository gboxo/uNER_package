FEV1was considered in the normal range when above the lower limit of normal (LLN), corresponding to a z-score of \u22121.64. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized according to the nutritional goal for CF, that is a BMI at or above 22 kg/m2(females) and 23 kg/m2(males) for those >18 years of age.10For pwCF \u226418 years of age we used BMI z-score computed on the CDC references,11with nutritional goal at or above 0 z-score.10Countries were classified into two groups (low versus high income) based on gross national income (GNI) per capita in 2017, obtained from the World Bank tables.12 We interpreted the course of CF disease as characterized by different types of events occurring after diagnosis. When considering CF from the perspective of respiratory disease, pwCF can die without having had LTx or can receive LTx and then die and we therefore used the multi-state model to estimate the transition probabilities of patients between these events (otherwise calledstates).13As summarized inFigure 1, pwCF could have been enrolled in the ECFSPR alive and without LTx, eventually being in a successive state (eg, alive with LTx, death without LTx), or they could have been enrolled alive with LTx, eventually transitioning to death with LTx. Furthermore, to assess the effect of individual risk factors on the transition probabilities from one state to the other, a multi-state regression model was fitted using age as timescale. The explanatory variables included in this model are: exposure to oxygen therapy, FEV1z-score (categorized as above or below the LLN, as recommended14); age at diagnosis (categorized as <1 year, 1\u201318 years, >18 years); sex, CFTR genotype (categorized as severe \u2013 with both alleles in class 1, 2 or 3, mild \u2013 with at least one allele in class 4 or 5, unknown); BMI nutritional goal; presence of diabetes treated with daily insulin; chronicPseudomonas aeruginosa(PSA); chronicBurkholderia cepaciacomplex (BCC); use of pancreatic enzymes; history of pneumothorax; history of hemoptysis >250mL; GNI (low and high income countries).Figure 1Multi-state model for pwCF: arrows denote direction of transition probabilities (T): from alive without LTx to alive with LTx (T1) or to death (T2); and from alive with LTx to death (T3). states Pseudomonas aeruginosa Burkholderia cepacia Multi-state model for pwCF: arrows denote direction of transition probabilities (T): from alive without LTx to alive with LTx (T1) or to death (T2); and from alive with LTx to death (T3). Presence of oxygen supplementation is collected by the ECFSPR as oxygen therapy during the year of follow-up; this variable was included in the model as a time-dependent variable since a subject can enter the registry and not be on oxygen therapy and then begin oxygen therapy during follow-up; this change is taken into account in the model. On the other hand, all other variables are included in the model considering their value at baseline, that is the time of entry in the registry.

Due to the small number of studies, separate meta-analyses for speech and noise maskers for the conditions e to h could not be run (it would have led to fewer than 5 studies per analysis); hence both noise and speech maskers were included in these analyses. In several studies, there were multiple (non-independent) outcomes, which were dealt with in the following way. First, for studies reporting SPiN performances in conditions eligible for different meta-analyses, for example one outcome with a noise masker and another one with a two-talker speech masker, the issue was automatically resolved by separating them in the different meta-analyses (Borenstein et al., 2009). Second, when studies presented various outcomes eligible for the same meta-analysis, the most represented experimental condition in the meta-analysis was always preferred. For example, when a study presented outcomes with two different noise maskers such as a white noise and a speech-shaped noise, the speech-shaped noise was always used in meta-analysis a); or when a study presented both the WIN and the QuickSIN (which only happened in 3 studies) \u2014two tasks with a four-talker masker\u2014the QuickSIN was always used in meta-analysis given that this was the most common test of SPiN, d). Third, when a study presented various outcomes eligible for the same meta-analysis but with an additional experimental manipulation, such as results with the same noise masker but with variations in the stimuli's F(0) or the SNR levels, an average score of these different results was calculated and used in meta-analysis a) (Borenstein et al., 2009). Finally, when two studies eligible for the same meta-analysis had exactly the same participants in their sample, we included only one of them. Therefore, in the SNR> 0\u00a0dB meta-analysis, we included data from Zendel et al. (2019), but not from Fleming et al. (2019). For each meta-analysis, a random-effect model was used to take into account the variability in SPiN tasks and participant characteristics (Borenstein et al., 2009). The random effect meta-analyses were conducted using the RMetaforpackage (R 4.2.1; R Development Core Team) running on Windows 11. Due to the small number of studies per analysis, Hedge's g (Borenstein et al., 2009) was used for each analysis as a power estimate (bias-corrected standardized mean differences). Hedge's g of <0.5, 0.5\u20130.8, and> 0.8 were considered as small, moderate, and high, respectively (Cohen, 1988). The Cochrane's Q test and I2statistics (Higgins et al., 2003) were used to assess the between-study heterogeneity. For the Cochrane's Q test, to indicate the presence of between-study heterogeneity, an alpha level of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance. I2values of 25%\u201350%, 50%\u201375%, and \u226575% were considered as low, moderate, and high between-study heterogeneity, respectively (Higgins et al., 2003). To test whether any study was overly influential on the effect size estimate, we conducted a leave-one-out cross-validation in each meta-analysis (Viechtbauer, 2010). Finally, meta-regressions (Huizenga et al., 2011) were also conducted to assess the potential moderating impact of different factors on SPiN performance. First, the mean of the musician and non-musicians\u2019 mean ages were computed and used as a continuous moderator, \u201cmean age,\u201d in each analysis. Second, to evaluate the effect of study quality, the scores obtained on the QualSyst evaluation tool were used as a continuous moderator, \u201cstudy quality,\u201d in each meta-analysis. The little number of available studies prevented the assessment of other potential moderators, such as the target's linguistic level (syllable, word, sentences) or the masker type (noise masker, speech masker) in meta-analyses c) and d).

Univariable and multivariable regression models were constructed. We determined the risks of PCAKI among the participants with sCr measurements depending on the implementation of the alert system, using logistic regression. Two different definitions of PCAKI were used: 1) at least 0.5 mg/dL or 25% increase in sCr [15]; and 2) at least 0.3 mg/dL or 50% increase in sCr [16]. Severe PCAKI was defined as an \u226550% increase in sCr from the baseline.

Cox regression analyses were performed for mortality and RRT since these were regarded as time-to-event variables. Subgroup analyses were performed for baseline eGFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Additionally, analyses were conducted to determine the publication trends in recent years. The frequency of use of keywords by years allows us to understand the conceptual structure of the breastfeeding literature. In this analysis step, the relationships and trends among keywords were examined. Keyword formation network analysis shows which concepts are at the forefront of breastfeeding-related research and how these concepts are related to each other.

As the disadvantages of PSA testing may be more difficult to understand than the advantages (\u201cA simple blood test may reduce your risk of dying from cancer\u201d), we decided first to test the hypothesis that education level was associated with the perception of the information about disadvantages. We chose to primarily analyse the responses of men who had not previously had a PSA test, because they had probably not earlier taken a personal stand on prostate cancer testing. Men who did not know whether they had previously been PSA tested were grouped with those who responded that they had not been tested previously. Throughout, response options were dichotomised. We chose to dichotomise the responses as \u201cvery clear\u201d versus all others, because we believe it to be essential that men really understand the disadvantages before they decide to have a PSA test. The highest level of education was dichotomised as nonacademic (primary or secondary school) or academic (high school or university) education in all analyses. Secondary analyses included other associations between educational level and perception of the clarity of the advantages and disadvantages, whether the men thought that they had received sufficient information to make a decision (responses categorised as \u201cyes, completely\u201d vs all other answers), and whether the previously tested men had searched additional information elsewhere.

The black line indicates the mean, and the gray area shows the 95% confidence interval of the mean. The incidence rate ratio was calculated by comparing the incidence in 2000 and the incidence in 2019 for each age group. To test for significant time trends, we used a likelihood ratio test that compared a model with and without calendar time. To control for a small number of cases in annual rates within age groups, we combined calendar time into 5\u2010year intervals and calculated incidence rates per 1000 person\u2010years with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each time and age group.

Patients without an event were censored at their last recorded follow-up. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models were used to analyze the association between the GPS result and time from RT completion to an event (BCF, DM, PCSM). The first multivariable model incorporated the GPS result along with biopsy grade group (based on central Gleason score), log2(PSA)21,22at diagnosis, clinical T stage, percentage of positive cores (the number of positive biopsy cores divided by the total number of cores), and patient age at diagnosis. These variables were selected a priori based on known clinical risk factors of prostate cancer.4,23The second and third models incorporated the GPS result along with the NCCN risk group or the continuous University of California, San Francisco Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (UCSF-CAPRA) score,23respectively.

Log-linear analysis, with a log link function, was used for analyses of integer response variables (Aitkin et al. 1989,Crawley 1993) and logistic analyses, with a logit link function, were used for most analyses of proportional response variables (Crawley 1993,Wilson and Hardy 2002). In log-linear analysis and logistic analyses of grouped binary data, quasi-Poisson and quasi-binomial distributions of residuals were adopted, using empirically estimated scale parameters, to take potential over- or underdispersion into account (Crawley 1993,Wilson and Hardy 2002,Hardy and Smith 2023). For data on the proportion of observations of foundresses on each host, angular transformation was used prior to Gaussian parametric analysis, with an identity link function, followed by post hoc Tukey\u2019s tests with a Type I error rate of <0.05. Nonparametric analysis using a contingency table was additionally employed to explore the positional association of foundresses with host species according to the host they developed on (we regard this analysis as illustrative rather than formal, seeTable 2).

Schoenfeld plot tested that survival curves for different strata have hazard functions that are proportional over the time t, and (II) Martingale and Schoenfeld residuals plots tested that the relationship between the log hazard and each covariate was linear. The results of multivariable Cox analysis are presented as estimated hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and p-values. Collinearity was assessed among the variables included in the multivariable analysis by using variance inflation factors (VIF). VIFs value of less than 5 show absence of any significant collinearity. In addition, a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for age and MELD score was performed to evaluate factors associated with AWS (predictors and clinical outcomes). We tested assumptions for logistic regression models that included independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly influential outliers. The results of multivariable logistic regression are presented as estimated odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CI and p-values. All tests were two-sided and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY.

Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the study population, divided into postoperative OU and NOU and to analyse postoperative opioid prescriptions during the 1-year observation period. The 50 postoperative weeks were first divided into 10-week intervals to assess crude opioid prescribing patterns. Subsequently, the first 10 postoperative weeks were divided into 1-week intervals to obtain a more granular picture of postoperative prescribing patterns. To test for differences in the total number of patients receiving opioids between time intervals Cochran tests were used in a first step. Differences between two successive time periods were assessed using post-hoc McNemar tests. Variations in opioid prescriptions between patients with and without preoperative opioid prescriptions were determined using the two-sample \u03c72test in each interval. In our regression model, we used the number of opioid prescriptions as dependent variable. As independent variables, we included both sociodemographic (gender, age, language region, comorbidity status) and insurance variables (managed care, high deductible) because we were interested in determining the patient populations with increased opioid needs. At the same time, several studies indicate that conservative physical therapy prior to KR results in lower post-KR opioid needs.35 36Therefore, we included utilisation of services in physical therapy, acupuncture and medication (non-opioids) for pain management 1\u2009year before the KR intervention. Because a large strand of literature demonstrated the correlation between preoperative and postoperative opioids,9 37\u201346we also included the presence of preoperative (12 months preceding KR) opioid prescriptions as an explanatory variable.

Negative binomial model had smaller deviations between the predictions and the actual values as it showed the lowest criterion values. The results of our models are illustrated by the incidence rate ratio (IRRs). Regarding the specification of the model, a slight correlation was found between older age and presence of supplementary hospital insurance.

Differences between groups were assessed based on Jaccard distance and Aitchison distances and were plotted using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. Statistical comparisons for beta-diversity measures were assessed on the dissimilarity matrix using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 999 permutations and via comparing the distance between groups using the Wilcoxon test.

Correlation analysis was conducted to assess relationships between the abundance of specific taxa, Bristol stool score, and other continuous measures. Details of these methods have also been used in previous studies by our group.14Relative abundances are expressed as the median percent relative abundance. The microbiome data and dietary and clinical factors were used to determine their association with the abundance of specific bacterial species through Spearman's correlation in R. p We used several approaches to evaluate if microbial taxonomic abundance was altered in T1D status using supervised models. First, we employed, Multivariate methods with unbiased variable selection in R (MUVR) to identify features predictive of T1D status. MUVR uses recursive variable selection with a repeated double cross-validation scheme.15Within the MUVR, variable ranking and selection are performed in an inner validation loop, and the final model performance is then assessed using observations in the test segment that are not used for model training or tuning. In the random forest core model, in each of the inner training models, variables are ranked by mean decrease in Gini index. For each iteration of variable tuning, variable ranks are averaged between the inner models. Model performance is then estimated from predictions of the untouched test segments using the number of selected variables (and an optimal number of components) determined by consensus from all inner observations. Minimal-optimal variables and all relevant (maximum) variables were identified by random forest core modeling. Model performance was assessed using the rfUtilities package. To compare features selected via MUVR with other methods, we utilized combined genus and species level abundance to predict T1D status using the H2o.ai engine and the h2o R package. Initial model evaluation performed using the AutoML function in H2o employed multiple model families, including distributed random forest, GLM and XGBoost.16AutoML automates processes of grid search and hyperparameter tuning. XGBoost models showed the best performance, and hence were chosen for further refinement. The XGBoost algorithm is a decision-tree based ensemble learning method that uses a gradient boosting framework. Measures of model performance included mean per-class error, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision derived from the confusion matrix. Given the relatively small sample size, model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. Important features contributing to the model were derived using a scaled variable importance determined by calculating the relative influence of each variable. A further lead model interpretation was done using the DALEX and DALEXtra packages which include tools for explainable AI. This included generating an explainable model (using the explain_h2o function) and evaluating important of variables using a permutational model-agnostic approach through the 1 minus AUC value (that is loss of model performance attributed to a feature).",

First, differences in estimated baseline concentration and evolution during follow-up between patients who reached the PEP and those who remained endpoint free were evaluated using linear mixed-effect (LMEs) modelling adjusted for the MAGGIC risk score.18By using LME modelling, we effectively account for the inherent correlation among repeated measurements within each patient. S3 Next, protein concentrations estimated by unadjusted LME models were standardized and used in the regularized time-varying Cox regression model. We used a regularized time-varying Cox regression model with an elastic net penalty to select a lean subset of circulating proteins with strong prognostic value on top of clinical predictors and established biomarkers. In particular, the Cox model included the MAGGIC risk score, repeated measures of clinical NT-proBNP, and hs-TnT (all unpenalized) as well as standardized values of all 4210 repeatedly measured SOMAscan proteins (except for NT-proBNP and TnT; penalized). For the selection of the optimal shrinkage penalty (\u03bb), 10-fold cross-validation of the model was performed. The discriminative ability of the final prediction model (i.e. the model containing the MAGGIC risk score, NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, and circulating proteins selected in the previous step) was determined using internal and external validation. For internal validation, a 10-fold cross-validated concordance index (c-index) was used. We compared the discriminative ability to that of a model containing clinical characteristics (i.e. the MAGGIC risk score), a clinical practice\u2013based biomarker model (i.e. the MAGGIC risk score, NT-proBNP, and hs-TnT) and a literature-based biomarker model [i.e. the MAGGIC risk score, NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, C-reactive protein (CRP), growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (ST2), and galectin-3 (Gal-3)]. For external validation, we calculated thec-index in HFPGR to determine the discriminative ability of the final prediction model as derived from Bio-SHiFT and the models described above. c c Because the regularized Cox model optimizes predictive ability at the expense of biasedly estimated regression coefficients, to estimate the unbiased associations between the repeatedly measured variables selected in the previous step, and the PEP, we applied joint modelling (JM).

We also used linear spline mixed\u2010effects models to examine associations between individual prenatal PFASs and repeated BP measures from birth to midchildhood and between midchildhood PFASs and repeated BP measures from midchildhood to late adolescence. In this analysis, we categorized PFAS levels into tertiles. We placed 2 knots at 6 and 13\u2009years for the spline, which allowed us to divide the study period into 3 distinct child life stages: (1) infancy to early childhood (0 to <6\u2009years), (2) midchildhood (6 to <13\u2009years), and (3) adolescence (\u226513\u2009years); this classification is consistent with our previous work.27,28We predicted BP values from 0 to 20\u2009years, with all covariates held at their mean values, and plotted the trajectories. To compare differences in BP trajectories by PFAS levels, we used Wald tests to estimate the probability that all product terms of PFAS tertiles and age splines are equal to 0, and we consideredP<0.10 as evidence of differences in BP trajectories. P To evaluate PFASs as a mixture, we calculated an exposure burden score for PFAS mixtures using a novel method developed by Liu et al.18This method uses item response theory to develop exposure burden scores for PFAS mixtures with biomonitoring data from the 2017 to 2018 NHANES as the reference and creates a composite PFAS burden score that is independent of the health outcome and comparable across studies. We used linear regression models to examine associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposure burden scores with BP at each subsequent follow\u2010up visit. A priori, we identified confounders defined as covariates expected to be associated with the exposures and outcomes but not on the potential causal pathway. For analyses of prenatal PFASs, we adjusted for the following covariates: maternal age, race and ethnicity (non\u2010Hispanic White; non\u2010Hispanic Black; others [including Hispanic, non\u2010Hispanic Asian, >1 race, and other race; categories combined due to small sample sizes]), household income at the first trimester (>$70\u2009000/year versus not), prepregnancy BMI (normal or underweight, overweight, obesity), nulliparous (yes, no), chronic hypertension (yes, no), and pregnancy smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, smoked during pregnancy).

We used the multiple imputation by chained equations method (10 imputations and each with 10 iterations) to impute missing values for covariates included in the regression models.29We investigated whether the associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposures with BP differed by child sex by including a product term of child sex and log2\u2010transformed PFASs in the multivariable models.

Categorical variables were described by their frequency and the percentage of each response.

Quantitative variables were described using their frequency, mean, standard deviation (SD), and minimum and maximum values. Target sample sizes were based on general principles of ideal minimum numbers of participants needed to detect statistical differences between participant experience with ravulizumab versus prior treatment with eculizumab. However, the final sample size was based on availability in this rare population. For statistical comparisons, statistical tests were two-sided using a significance level of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.

For questions that examined treatment preference on a 5-point Likert scale (from \u2018strongly prefer ravulizumab\u2019 to \u2018strongly prefer eculizumab\u2019), the binomial test was used to compare the proportion of those who indicated any preference for ravulizumab versus those who indicated either \u2018no preference\u2019 or any preference for eculizumab.

    "24625": "This work extends our previous analysis, where the maximal cell replicative capacity (measured as PD) across species was found to be positively correlated with the body mass of those species and uncorrelated with their longevity [18]. In the present work, the same analysis has been repeated considering more species (more details in Section \u201cReplicative capacity measurement\u201d) and including BMRr as candidate explanatory variable for the PD. Moreover, an analogous analysis has been performed to quantify the correlation of the IP of the cell strains across species with body mass, maximum longevity, and BMRr. The whole statistical analysis has been performed using the software R and the RStudio GUI (https://www.R-project.org/,http://www.posit.co/). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been fitted to the collected data, measuring the correlation of proliferative or immortalizing capacities of the cells (dependent/response variables) with longevity, body mass and BMRr (independent/explanatory variables). Performing an MLR allows to quantify the correlation of each independent variable with the dependent variable, net of the relation of the latter with any other independent variable included in the model. In this case, for example, it has allowed us to assess the relationship between longevity and proliferative or immortalizing capacity controlling for mass (and vice versa). For the regression with PD as a dependent variable, the standard linear model has been fitted using the R functionlm. In agreement to what has been previously done by Ref.\u00a0[26], the values of longevity, mass and PD have been log-transformed prior to the analysis. The resulting regression equation is:ln(PD)=\u03b20+\u03b21\u2217ln(mass)+\u03b22\u2217ln(long)+\u03b23\u2217BMRrwherelongis the maximum longevity of the species andmassis their average adult body mass. lm long mass For the regressions with IP as a dependent variable, the quasi-binomial logistic model has been fitted using the R functionglm. Also in this case, the values of longevity and mass have been log-transformed. The resulting regression equation is:IP=11+e\u2212[\u03b20+\u03b21\u2217ln(mass)+\u03b22\u2217ln(long)+\u03b23\u2217BMRr] glm The correlation between each independent variable and the dependent variable in both models has been assessed using thet-values. In a MLR each t-value is a measure of thepartial correlationbetween one independent variable and the dependent variable, net of the effect of the other independent variable(s). Based on these values,t-testsare conducted to check the null hypothesis of \u201cno correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable\". t-values partial correlation t-tests Moreover, theAkaike Information Criterion(AIC) andBayesian Information Criterion (BIC)have been used to assess the performance of the models about PD, while the goodness of fit of the models about IP has been assessed through theanalysis of deviance(F test) on each model. It is important to highlight that all these techniques do not allow to compare models fitted on different sets of observations. Hence, to compare the models with BMRr as regressor and the ones without it, it has been necessary to refit the models without BMRr on the subset of species for which the BMR was available. Akaike Information Criterion Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) analysis of deviance The\u201ccrude\u201d pairwise linear correlationsbetween log-transformed body mass, longevity, BMR and PD have been computed using thePearson correlation coefficient, r. Also thepartial correlationbetween each independent variable and each the dependent variable, controlling for the other independent variables, has been computed. \u201ccrude\u201d pairwise linear correlations Pearson correlation coefficient partial correlation To measure the partial correlationrxy,zbetween two variables x and y net of a third variable z (controlling variable) the following procedure has been used. Two regression models are fitted, one analyzing the relation among z and x and the other analyzing the relation among z and y. The correlation among the residuals of these two models is the partial correlation between x and y controlling for z. This procedure allows to produce theresidual\u2013residual plot, providing a visual representation of the relation between x and y controlling for z. If the crude correlations (rxy,rxz, andryz) are available, the partial correlation can be equivalently computed as follows:rxy,z=rxy\u2212(rxz\u2217ryz)(1\u2212rxz)2\u2217(1\u2212ryz)2In this study, the functionpcorfrom the R packageppcorhas been used to compute the partial correlations between:\u2022PD and mass, controlling for longevity and BMRr;\u2022PD and longevity, controlling for mass and BMRr;\u2022PD and BMRr, controlling for mass and longevity. residual\u2013residual plot pcor ppcor PD and mass, controlling for longevity and BMRr; PD and longevity, controlling for mass and BMRr; PD and BMRr, controlling for mass and longevity. The regression models described above have also been re-fitted considering the phylogenetic relation between the species. This has been done using the R functionglsfrom the packagenlme, which allows to performphylogenetic regression, i.e., a regression in which the correlation matrix of the residuals is proportional to a correlation matrix derived from the phylogenetic tree of the species under analysis. The scaling coefficient for the correlation matrix, which must be between 0 and 1, is calledPagel \u03bb: if it is equal to 0, there is no phylogenetic signal in the residuals; if it is equal to 1 there is the maximum possible amount of phylogenetic signal in the residuals, and the model is equivalent to aBrownian motionmodel. To perform the phylogenetic regression, 100 phylogenetic trees have been generated by the online tool developed by VertLife (available athttps://vertlife.org/phylosubsets/). They have been imported on R using the packageape, and the most representative tree has been selected using three methods:average,medianandconsensus. The same tree, displayed inFig.\u00a01, was found to be representative with all the methods.

    "40739": "To test our first prediction, we assessed whether chimpanzees were more likely to utter a vocal sequence when exposed to concomitant events as compared to single events using a binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM)86with log link function. The response in this model was whether the utterance was a vocal sequence (y/n) (no denoting single calls and yes denoting vocal sequences, i.e., utterance with at least two different vocal units being combined). We used a categorical predictor corresponding to concomitant events (y/n), that is, whether the vocal utterance was emitted during a single or a concomitant event. We used such a statistical approach since at the repertoire level, we did not expect a 1:1 matching of the number of events and the number of vocal units in the sequence. This was because, first, whilst we had up to 5 concomitant events, we recorded sequences of up to 10 vocal units. Second, some sequences may follow non-compositional rules, resulting in sequences with more units than the number of events. Third, if some events are more salient than others, such that not all concomitant events elicit vocal utterances, there may be cases where there are more events than vocal units in the utterance. In our statistical model, we controlled for group identity as a fixed effect. As we have several utterances per individual, we included caller identity as a random effect to avoid pseudo-replication. Moreover, for half of the individuals, we have data from two field seasons, collected one year apart. Hence, we also included a dummy variable season_ID as another random factor to account for repeated sampling of the same individual during the same field season, as the age of individuals changes from one season to the next and hence the events individuals engage in and their vocal repertoires might also change. To keep the type I error rate at the nominal level of 5% we included all identifiable random slopes.87Particularly, we included a random slope of our predictor variable (concomitant event y/n) within caller identity and within field season. To avoid concomitant testing, we conducted a full-null model comparison,88where the null model only lacked the predictor concomitant event (y/n), but included group identity as a control predictor and was otherwise identical to the full model. This comparison was based on a likelihood ratio test.89 To study the effect of age on the relationship between the length of utterances and events, we fitted another model with the same structure asmodel 1a, but with a subsample of the data containing only adults (Model 1b). We considered individuals to be immature when <10 years, given that individuals at this age have reached the adult vocal repertoire level regarding the length of utterances and diversity of unique utterances (i.e., the number of distinct utterances uttered).57Each vocal utterance constituted a data point. The sample formodel 1aencompasses 9391 utterances from 98 individuals (0\u201355 years old) and the sample forModel 1bincludes 5399 utterances from 53 adult individuals (10\u201355 years). In both models, we included data from the three groups. Model 1b Model 1b The R script formula for Model 1(a-b): glmer (vocal sequence y/n \u223c concomitant event y/n\u00a0+ group identity\u00a0+ (1\u00a0+ concomitant event y/n | caller identity)\u00a0+ (1 | field season), family\u00a0= binomial). With the second model we wanted to evaluate the relation between the diversity of utterances (or \u201crepertoire size\u201d) and the diversity of events per individual; that is the number of unique or different vocal utterances that an individual produced (response) and the number of unique events in which each individual vocalised (predictor) (Figure\u00a0S1A). As both variables were highly correlated with sample size (total number of utterances for a given chimpanzee and field season,Figure\u00a0S1A;Figure\u00a03A), we first had to control for this effect. To do so, we fitted two linear regressions one for each of the desired variables (log-transformed) as a function of the sample size (log-transformed) and extracted the respective residuals (the difference of each observation of the respective response estimated fitted value) (Figures\u00a0S1C and S1D). The R formula for the two initial models was: Residuals diversity of utterances\u00a0= as.vector (residuals (lm (log (number unique utterances) \u223c log (sample size)))) Residuals diversity of events\u00a0= as.vector (residuals (lm (log (number unique events) \u223c log (sample size)))) As a second step, we modeled the relationship between the residuals of each model using a Linear Mixed Model (LMM)86with the residual diversity of utterances as the response and the residual diversity of events as the predictor variable. We used a Gaussian error distribution and identity link function (Figure\u00a0S1B). We controlled for group identity as a fixed effect and for caller identity as a random intercept. We used the Satterthwaite approximation for the model estimated using restricted maximum likelihood REML (R package lmerTest).90We conducted a full-null model comparison,88where the null model lacked the predictor \u2018residuals of the diversity of events\u2019 but was otherwise identical to the full model. For this model, we used one data point per chimpanzee per field season which resulted in 152 data points from 98 individuals (0\u201355 years old) out of 3 groups. The R script formula for model 2a: lmerTest::lmer (Residuals of the diversity of utterances \u223c 1+ Residuals of the diversity of events\u00a0+ group identity\u00a0+ (1 | caller identity), REML\u00a0= T). To compare the relevance of considering the impact of concomitant events on utterance diversity, we fitted a new model similar tomodel 2a, which only included the number of unique single events as a predictor. In this case, we broke down the concomitant events into their building\u00a0units. For instance, when considering concomitant events as distinct, an individual vocalising in the following events: affiliation, approach and one concomitant event affiliation+approach, was coded as vocalising in three unique events (model 2a). When not considering concomitant events as distinct, in this example, the individual would be coded as vocalising in two unique events (Model 2b). All the other parameters and procedures of the model remained the same as inmodel 2a. The sample for this model encompassed again 152 data points from 98 individuals (0\u201355 years old). We compared the effect size (R2) and AIC values of both models (2a and 2b) to assess which model fitted the data better. To analyze the effect of age on the strength of the relationship between the diversity of utterances and the diversity of events, we fitted an additional model exactly as formodel 2a, but with a subsample of the data including only adults (>10 years) (Model 2c). For this model, we used 73 data points from 51 individuals (10\u201355 years old), from 3 chimpanzee groups. Model 2c We fitted the models in R 4.1.191using the functions glmer and lmer (R package lme4).92Before fitting the models, we tested collinearity between our predictor variables using the function vif (R package \u201ccar\u201d), which did not reveal any issue (Variance Inflation Factor of all predictors <1.12).93After fitting the models, we assessed model stability for all models by excluding each level of each random effect one at a time (function provided by Roger Mundry); all models were stable.94For Model 2 (Linear Mixed Model), we also visually checked the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneous residuals using QQ-plots of residuals and residuals plotted against fitted values.93The plots did not reveal obvious deviations from the assumptions. We assessed the significance of each predictor variable using an LRT between the full model and a reduced model comprising all the variables except the one being evaluated using the function drop1.92We calculated effect sizes using the function r.squaredGLMM (R package \u201cMuMin\u201d). We derived 95% confidence intervals by means of parametric bootstraps (function provided by Roger Mundry). We did not include sex and rank as predictors in any model, as it has been shown that these variables do not affect the response variables used here.57",

These factors were selected based on both previous research and availability of information for all subjects. For this we employed three multiple regression analyses. Each predicted accuracy on one of the three speech perception measures (CCT [N = 114], CNC [N = 89], and AzBio [N = 72]). Our plan was to first examine the data with bivariate analyses, to examine the spread of the data and assess other factors, such as collinearity. We then conducted large-scale multivariable analyses, predicting each performance outcome from ERP measures and individual factors. We considered two ERP measures as potential predictors of performance: the N1-P2 amplitudes to the target word (N1-P2target), and the N1-P2 amplitudes to the noise (N1-P2noise). The relationship of the EEG measures to performance was assessed accounting for several other factors. These included duration of device use (log-scaled in months; DeviceDuration), average of residual low-frequency hearing thresholds (250 and 500 Hz; PTAlow) and current age (age). Correlations that reached significance but where |r| <0.30 were described as small. Correlations where |r| \u2265 0.3 and |r| < 0.5 can be interpreted as moderate. These values are consistent with the approach suggested byCohen (1988,1992). We then related each predictor to speech perception performance on (1) CCT task (which was conducted simultaneously with the EEG), CNC task or AzBio, in three separate multiple regression models. The final model is given in (1), in the syntax of the lm() function in R, where the initial \u201c1\u201d explicitly refers to the intercept term. For the CCT task, the dependent variable (Speech Perception) was the mean accuracy in the low SNR condition. This condition was selected as it is the most difficult and therefore best reflects a subject\u2019s difficulty in understanding SiN. For the CNC and AzBio tasks, mean performance on each task was used as a dependent variable in separate models. The regressions were limited to the specific N1-P2 ERP components for the reasons described earlier. A key factor when in a multiple linear regression is the normality of the residuals. Normality testing was also performed on the residuals for each dependent variable using Shapiro-Wilk tests. All variables tested were confirmed to meet this prerequisite. We also conducted exploratory analyses on the full time-course of the EEG signal, by collapsing listeners into two categories (good and poor performers)\u2014defined using a median split\u2014and comparing them at each timepoint using a cluster-based permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld 2007). Significant clusters were included if they lasted for a minimum of 50 msec (i.e., 13 samples at 256 Hz sampling rate). A similar approach was conducted by collapsing trials in the CCT into the high- and low-SNR conditions. All statistical analyses were carried out using custom-written Matlab scripts. Correlation coefficients represent the results of Pearson\u2019s correlations, while residualization against age was performed using least squares linear regression.",

Analyses were corrected for parental sex, since questionnaires were not necessarily completed by the same parent throughout the study course, and differences between parental proxy reports have been previously documented.28Results were presented as regression coefficients (B) with 95% CI. The percentage of patients with clinically impaired generic HRQoL was calculated per timepoint for each subscale. Clinical impairment was defined as a proxy generic HRQoL score of more than one SD below the reference value (=16% in the general population).27We used \u03c72goodness-of-fit tests to determine if the proportions of patients with clinically impaired HRQoL were significantly different between the study population and the general population. As norm data for PedQL cancer scale do not exist, the percentage of patients with clinically impaired cancer-specific HRQoL was not calculated. We did calculate the proportion of patients per timepoint with \u2018never\u2019 (score 100), \u2018almost never\u2019 (75\u2013100), \u2018sometimes\u2019 (50\u201374), \u2018often\u2019 (25\u201349) or \u2018almost always\u2019 (0\u201324) problems for each subscale. Sociodemographic and medical factors associated with the longitudinal development HRQoL scores were determined with linear mixed model analyses with a random intercept on child level. The following variables were analysed: patient age (continuous), patient sex and ALL risk group. Risk group was dichotomised into SR versus MR/HR due to a low number of HR participants. Additionally, parent highest education level, patient pain and patient pre-existent chronic illness were also included for generic HRQoL. Parent highest educational level was interpreted as a derivative of familial socioeconomic status and defined according to Statistics Netherlands.23 29Due to the small number of low educated parents, educational level was dichotomised as low/middle (no education up to pre-university education and intermediate vocational education) and high (higher vocational education, university). For pain, we dichotomised clinically relevant versus non-clinically relevant pain with a cut-off score of 4 or higher as pre-established in the literature.30For chronic illness, a yes/no dichotomisation was used due to the low number of reported comorbidities. Multivariable models were created via backward selection to determine which of the aforementioned factors were associated with the longitudinal development of HRQoL scores. Variables with the highest p value were deleted from the multivariable model in a stepwise approach until only variables with a p value below 0.10 remained. All models were corrected for parent sex. Effects were shown as regression coefficients (B) with SE and 95% CI. for all linear mixed models.",

We also used a Cox regression model for the ever-screened patients to explore the association between time to diagnosis (ie, from the last FIT) and death from colorectal cancer after diagnosis. Because the association might be nonlinear, we used a restricted cubic spline (knots placed at the 3rd, 6th, and 12th months) to fit the dose-response curve. We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the stability of our results, adjusting for other colorectal cancer staging systems (including more detailed AJCC, Dukes\u2019, and SEER staging), and for several prognosis-related clinicopathological variables (including tumor grading, tumor size, lymph node ratio, circumferential resection margin, perineural invasion, bowel obstruction, and bowel perforation).

Previous cohort studies in Australia have recorded low deaths, lost to follow-up or withdrawal rates of 3.4% from enrolment to birth, and 5% from enrolment to 12 months.52Where possible, all data captured will be recorded as continuous measures to allow the extraction of maximum information content. Preliminary data analyses will include comparison of key demographic and characteristics of the cohort to the broader population to assess cohort representativeness, in line with previous pregnancy cohorts.28 52Parental characteristics including age, socioeconomic status, education and ethnicity and pregnancy-related variables such as parity, pregnancy-related complications, gestation at birth, neonatal intensive care admission, birth weight and caesarean section rate will be included in the analyses. Initial planned analyses for Stage 1 will include outcomes relating to pregnancy and obstetrics, maternal mental health and infant respiratory function. Specific pregnancy and obstetric outcomes would include gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, gestational age at birth, birth weight and neonatal intensive care admission. The impact of healthy nutrition in infancy on outcomes at the 6th month follow-up will also be examined. A total of 2500 study participants will ensure a sufficiently powered study to estimate the prevalence of uncommon (~5%) and common (>45%) disease, accounting for an absolute error of 1% and 3%, respectively.53For continuous traits, it is estimated that a minimum sample size of 1844 participants is needed to detect deviations from the population after accounting for non-normality in the trait.54Assuming a two-category group for nutritional status and stratifying the study population into five quintile groups, a minimum of 2154 participants would allow the detection of small to medium effects of an intervention.53For individual projects proposing to use the cohort study data, a description of the statistical analyses, including power calculations specific to each project, will form part of the application to the NEW1000 Study Executive. Statistical analyses will be performed using standardised software. Missing outcome data will not be imputed, as missing data are not likely to follow key assumption of data missing at random within this population. However, we will conduct sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation methods to explore potential impact of missing values.

    "39161": "Missing data imputation using We applied locally weighted scatterplot smoothing with a time-limit aware scheme (LOWESS-TLS) to impute the data. While LOWESS imputation has been used in geographical research, its use in BMI longitudinal studies is novel; moreover, our proposed combination of LOWESS with TLS is a novel method. Hence, we describe this two-step imputation method in detail below. TLS is the first step in the imputation procedure. In most longitudinal BMI studies, imputation is performed using all available data or data within a fixed-width time window centered on the time of the missing data. Herein, we use TLS to account for the age-varying dynamics of child growth. For missing monthly data from birth to age 1 year, imputation was performed using data no more than 4 months earlier or later; for missing quarterly data between age 1 and 2 years, data no more than 1 year earlier or later is used; for missing annual data between age 3 and 18 years, data no more than 2 years earlier or later is used. These variable-width time windows are schematically presented in Supplementary Figure S2,http://links.lww.com/PN9/A24, with an illustrative example. The second imputation step begins with the set of available data points within the TLS. When this set includes data points with ages both above and below that of the missing data, then LOWESS regression on the set of observations was used to predict the missing value.[34]For cases when only the last or next observations are available, last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) or next observation carried backwards (NOCB)[35]imputation was conducted. Finally, if there were no known BMIPCT measurements in the TLS time window, the missing data were not imputed and any subsequent analysis that requires this particular data point would not include this participant. Once all of the LOWESS-TLS imputations were completed for each participant, we linearly interpolated the imputed dataset to 18\u2009\u00d7\u200912 = 216 monthly values to simplify the subsequent trajectory analysis. The LOWESS-TLS imputed, linearly interpolated data was used to create 18 BMIPCT datasets as follows: datasetn(forn= 1, 2, \u2026, 18) contains data only up to agenyears and does not contain any missing data that could not be imputed using our TLS criteria, as explained above. For each of these BMIPCT datasets, we applied time-seriesK-means clustering[36]to obtain trajectories. To determine the number of trajectories to retain for subsequent analysis, we considered a range of possible numbers of trajectories (ie, the number of clustersk= 2, \u2026, 10 inK-means clustering), computed the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),[11,37,38]and selected the numberkcorresponding to the highest BIC. Euclidean distance was chosen forK-means clustering since our time series data were of equal durations and equally spaced time intervals. For comparison, we applied LCGA[39]as an alternative method and set the number of latent trajectory classes in LCGA the same askfor consistency. To allow for sex-specific trajectories and associations, all analyses were performed on the overall study population as well as on boys and girls, separately. n n n K k K k K k To examine associations between BMIPCT trajectory types and maternal factors, child sex, preterm and low birthweight status, we applied a two-sidedttest for continuous factors and the \u03c72test for categorical factors. We also conducted multinomial logistic regression, taking the identified normal trajectory as the reference category, and reported crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs and aORs). t After an investigation of the trajectory classes, we explored how trajectory information could be used to predict subsequent OWO risk. To accomplish this, we developed a preliminary prediction tool using early-age information (from birth to age 1 or 2 years) to inform parents about their child\u2019s risk of OWO at a critical developmental time window (from age 5 to 10 years),[40,41]with and without further consideration of prenatal and perinatal covariates. Binary logistic regression was used to predict middle-childhood OWO status. To assess if a child\u2019s early growth patterns (as represented by BMIPCT trajectories from birth to agen1years,n1= 1,2) could better predict middle-childhood OWO status at agen2years (n2= 5,6,\u2026,10) compared with conventional predictors or static BMI categories, we chose five different sets of predictors and collated their predictive performances on middle childhood OWO: (a) baseline maternal and infant factors, including maternal OWO status, race and ethnicity, education level, parity, smoking status, delivery type, preterm status, low birthweight, and breastfeeding type; (b) static BMIPCT measurement at agen1years, categorized into four levels: <5th, 5th to 85th, 85th to 95th, or \u226595th; (c) BMIPCT trajectory types from birth to agen1years; (d) the set of all predictors in sets (a) and (b); and (e) the set of all predictors in sets (a) and (c).

After the PCA analysis, we used a supervised multivariate orthogonal partial least squares\u2010discriminant analysis (OPLS\u2010DA) to model metabolic differences among groups. Orthogonal\u2010Signal\u2010Correction was used to filter the variations in the spectrometric data of the samples (predictor matrix or X) that are uncorrelated with the selected sample class (clinical data or Y). To assess the quality of the models, K\u2010fold cross\u2010validation was used. The results of the cross\u2010validation were summarized by the value of R2 and Q2 parameters; the first one summarizes the goodness of the fit (R2=\u20091 would indicate perfect fit), and Q2 the predictability of the model (Q2\u00a0=\u00a01 would indicate perfect predictability). APvalue was estimated from the K\u2010fold cross\u2010validation, and default SIMCA software 7\u2010fold cross\u2010validation software was used. To obtain further validation of the model, a permutation test was used (1000 permutations) regarding aPvalue less than or equal to 0.05 as a valid model. For the significant models, we used p(corr) parameter, which represents the loadings of the model scaled as a correlation coefficient, thus standardizing the range from \u22121.0 to 1.0. p(corr) cutoff was set at 0.5. R P P The integrals of significant metabolites were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test and Kruskal\u2013Wallis one\u2010way analysis of variance. The post hoc analysis after the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test.Pvalues were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing corrections with Benjamini\u2010Hochberg method for false discovery rate (FDR) calculation with an FDR cutoff set at 0.05. Aforementioned tests were performed with rstatix package forR. Visualizations were produced with ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap packages. P R Secondly, we wanted to investigate how FMT affected individual fecal metabolites. We used the 2\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to study differences in the temporal dynamics of identified fecal metabolites between the FMT and sham group. Finally, we correlated each of the fecal metabolites with the three key secondary end points of the trial in all patients, as well as in FMT\u2010treated patients. To assess these correlations, we used mixed effect models. These models were fitted with lme4 R package. The model was adjusted for sex, age, and body mass index, and the subject ID was introduced as a random effect to account for the longitudinal nature of the data.Pvalues were adjusted with FDR using the Benjamini\u2010Hochberg correction, and the cutoff was set at 0.10.

The adequacy of the final model was evaluated using a lowest Bayesian information criterion and >0.70 probability of belonging.20Finally, we applied the linear mixed\u2010effects model to calculate the slope of eGFR. eGFR slope can be thought of as eGFR change per year or annual change in eGFR, implying the direction and magnitude of the change in a subject's eGFR over the time period. Subjects were then categorized by quartiles of eGFR slope.21,22 Cox proportional hazards regression models were then used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of all studied outcomes by different trajectory groups, taking class I (high to mildly decreased group) or group I (the stable group) as reference and adjusting for age; sex; race; smoking status; drinking status; marital status; education level; history of hypertension, diabetes, CHF, or CHD; BMI; fasting glucose; total cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein, low\u2010density lipoprotein, and triglyceride; and baseline eGFR.

For ATAC-Seq track generation, output BAM files were converted into BigWig files using MACS2 and UCSC utilities127in order to display coverage throughout the genome in RPM values. For Cut and Tag libraries, the CutRunTools pipeline was leveraged to perform read trimming, quality filtering, alignment, peak calling, and track building using default parameters.128All sequencing data analyzed in this study have been deposited at NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE212357. For RNA-seq data, output gene count tables from STAR based on alignments to the hg19 reflat annotation were used as input into edgeR v3.12.1129to obtain normalized log CPM values and to evaluate differential gene expression. Log2fold change values from edgeR were used as input into GSEA,130and the GseaPreranked tool was run with default settings to measure gene set enrichment. For day 9 treatment comparisons, the DESeq2 v1.30.1 R software package was used to evaluate differential gene expression.131For heatmaps displaying differentially expressed genes, log CPMs were transformed into Z-scores followed by hierarchical or K-means clustering. In order analyze gene set enrichment for select subsets of genes, hypergeometric tests were performed on overlaps with various MSIGDB gene sets and select enriched gene sets were displayed. Principal component analysis was performed using the wt.scale and fast.svd functions from the corpcor R package on RPKM values,132,133which were quantified using median length isoforms and total mapped read counts computed by the Samtools idxstats function. The Bedtools multiIntersectBed and mergeBed functions were used for peak merging,134and the R package, ChIPpeakAnno v3.17.0,135was used to visualize peak overlaps. Distance-to-TSS peak distributions were computed utilizing Ensembl protein-coding gene coordinates. To generate the heatmap inFigure 1D, which served as a platform for several downstream analyses, first, 32 sets of peaks derived from the SS18 and SMARCA4 samples (called by the CutRunTools pipeline) from both donors and from all time points were merged with the Bedtools multiIntersectBed function. Since there wsere two donors for every time point, we removed any peaks or parts of peaks that did not overlap with at least one peak to remove outlier peaks and outlier peak segments. This overlap information from the 32 sets of peaks was provided by the output of the Bedtools multiIntersectBed function. After the outlier peaks and outlier peak segments were removed, the Bedtools mergeBed function was used to merge the filtered peaks. In an identical manner, the peaks of the H3K27ac and ATAC-seq samples were separately merged. Second, these three sets of merged peaks from all time points were overlapped and merged to generate the Venn Diagram inFigure S2I, which represent the sites in theFigure 1Dheatmap. Third, the Cut & Tag and ATAC-seq RPKM data from the merged peaks were log2transformed, followed by the separate quantile normalization of each BAF subunit, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq data across time points. Finally, K-means clustering was applied in a semi-unsupervised manor to partition the SMARCA4, SS18, H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data into the 9 groups or clusters, which are exhibited inFigure 1D, followed by transformation into Z-scores across timepoints to highlight the differences within clusters among time points. CUT&TAG datasets from two independent human T cell donors were merged and RPKM values were computed for SMARCA4, SS18, H3K27Ac and IgG samples for each timepoint across the T cell activation and exhaustion time course (as above). The RPKM values for each mark were log2-transformed and individually subjected to quantile normalization. Quantile-normalized IgG signals were then subtracted from the SMARCA4, SS18, and H3K27Ac quantile-normalized signals. From here, for selected figure panels, quantile-normalized, IgG-subtracted signal values were separately transformed into Z-scores for all timepoints. Finally, IgG control peaks that were present and overlapped SMARCA4, SS18 and H3K27Ac merged sites were removed, while maintaining the order of the non-overlapping sites. Heatmaps were generated from the resultant non-overlapping and IgG-subtracted sites. Principal component analyses (PCA) were also performed on these quantile-normalized log2-transformed RPKM values. For day 9 treatment analyses, DESeq2 was used to evaluate differential accessibility, and quantile-normalized log2RPKM values were transformed into Z-scores following by hierarchical clustering to display differentially accessible sites. Transcription factor enrichment and motif analyses were carried out by the LOLA v1.12.0136and HOMER v4.9137software packages, respectively. In addition to using HOMER to analyze motif enrichment, for several motif enrichment analyses conducted in this study, we determined the number of motif occurrences for 286 non-redundant archetype consensus motifs138within +/\u2212 250 base pairs of peak centers for each peak within given peak sets. The coordinates of these archetype motifs as well as non-archetype motifs across the entire human and mouse genomes can be downloaded from the following resourcehttps://www.vierstra.org/resources/motif_clustering#downloads. Average archetype and non-archetype motif occurrences and densities within all sites and within clusters of sites were also determined, and fractional enrichment values relative to all sites were displayed for select motifs with high occurrence and variability. The following formulas were used to compute motif densities and enrichment. These archetype motif fraction enrichment values in clusters were also plotted against corresponding TF gene log fold change values for several stepwise comparisons across the T-cell activation and exhaustion time course. For logistic regression analyses on archetype motifs, matrices of motif counts for given merged peaks were generated, and the R software program GLMnet139was used to produce logistic regression models to fit the motif counts to binomial vectors where 1\u2019s represented sites with BAF or ATACseq log2fold changes > 0. Divergent barplots were used to display large coefficients in output models to estimate the influence of motifs on BAF occupancy or accessibility in terms of magnitude, directionality and predictability. Data analysis was performed using MAGECK,119following the standard analysis pipeline reported inhttps://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/Home/.

GSEA output normalized enrichment scores or regular enrichment scores were displayed in heatmaps. Negative log base 10 p-values from select the indicated gene sets were displayed in barplots.

The count data for each Taxa were converted into relative abundance. To consider any possible batch effect while measuring taxa count, (1) only those taxa with at least 5% relative abundance in both batches were further considered in primary statistical analyses; (2) All models were controlled for a batch indicator variable along with other covariates. (3) Further detailed sensitivity analysis was conducted by choosing taxa with at least 25% relative abundance in both batches. The second and third-trimester Pb concentrations were log (base = 2) transformed to meet distributional assumptions with higher confidence. We calculated Shannon alpha diversity and Bray-Curtis beta diversity.(Shannon, 1948;Bray and Curtis, 1957) To estimate the associations with second and third-trimester lead concentrations, (1) for alpha diversity, we used the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (without covariate adjustment) and linear regression (with covariate adjustment); and (2) for beta diversity, we used PERMANOVA with 10000 permutations and w/o covariate adjustments.(Oksanen et al., 2019) We used the Weighted Quantile Sum (WQSRSRH) regression (Carrico et al., 2015) with random subset (Curtin et al., 2019) and repeated holdouts (Tanner et al., 2019), as established for microbiome data (Eggers et al., 2023), to estimate the association between second and third-trimester lead exposures and the effect on the abundance of the overall mixture of microbial taxa. Since the interest lies in the directionality of the association, the WQSRSRHmodel was fitted with all the chosen taxa as exposures and the log transformed Pb concentration as the outcome. For ease of interpretation, the relative abundance of the taxa was converted into deciles, while a null relative abundance was kept at zero. Moreover, two WQSRSRHmodels were fitted at each trimester, with the overall mixture effect assumed in the negative or positive directions. The final optimal model (Liao et al., 2018) from each trimester was chosen based on the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978). Those microbial taxa were judged important in the final chosen models, which had weight contributions to the overall mixture index above a chance threshold (1/the number of components in the index). Lastly, to account for any between taxa correlations and the relatively smaller sample size, each WQSRSRHmodel was fitted based on 200 repeated holdouts (with randomly 40% data set aside for validation) and 100 bootstrapped with-replacement sampling at each iteration. To estimate the effect of Pb exposure on individual relative abundance of each chosen taxa, we conducted Taxa-wide association analysis (TWAS) with generalized linear models at both trimesters. Further, the unadjusted raw p-values with respect to regression beta estimates were plotted through Volcano plots. The Bonferroni procedure was adapted for multiple comparison error correction on raw p-values. We estimated the effective number of tests for the TWAS using the eigenvalues of the relative abundance of the correlation matrix (Li and Ji, 2005;de Prado-Bert et al., 2021). We extracted the microbial gene function pathways of the important taxa from the WQSRSRHanalysis at each trimester. We selected the top 20 most frequently occurring pathways in each trimester for ease of interpretation. Through a simple Venn diagram, we further elaborated on the pathways which are common to a) both trimesters, b) only present in the second trimester, and lastly, c) only present in the third trimester. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to understand whether the choice of relative abundance in both batches affected the overall mixture effect. To that end, we repeated the entire WQSRSRHanalysis with only those taxa having at least 25% relative abundance in both batches. Further, we chose not to rescale the chosen taxa with at least 5% relative abundance (1) to reflect the original contributions and (2) to make the analysis robust irrespective of the chosen relative abundance cutoff. Each model was controlled bya priorichosen set of covariates. Although we thought Pb exposure during childhood may be a confounder, we tested the correlation between prenatal Pb and childhood Pb at birth, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years of age, and did not find a correlation, thus we decided to exclude these variables from the models.

Correlations between coronary physiology indices and age were adjusted for several potential cofounders, including, lesion stenosis diameter by QCA, interrogated target vessel with proximal LAD artery lesion, presence of hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, number of vessels interrogated per patient and patients presenting with ACS. Linear regression was performed to calculate correlations adjusted for the potential confounders.

The occurrence date of DKD was determined as the midpoint between the date of the first reported DKD screening and the last screening in which the participant did not have DKD.33 U We respectively calculated the tertile of LE8 score in different sex attributable to the substantial differences in the distribution of many aspects between men and women (TableS2). In the longitudinal analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the tertiles of baseline LE8 score and incident DKD. In addition, we set the baseline tertile as the grouping criteria for the LE8 score in subsequent follow\u2010ups when considering the variation of LE8 as time goes by (from 2006 to 2020). Time\u2010dependent Cox regression that could fully consider the time\u2010varying exposure in a cohort study has been applied for the biennially updated LE8.46 In the trajectory analysis, the SAS program, Proc Traj procedure, was used to classify LE8 trajectory patterns from 2006 to 2010 with latent mixture modeling according to previous studies.34,35,36,44,47First, a censored normal model, which is suitable for continuous outcomes, with Bayesian information criterion was performed. The minimum absolute Bayesian information criterion value suggests a well\u2010fitting model because it balances the complexity of the model with the degree of fit to the sample data. Second, a model with 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 trajectory pattern was fitted in sequence and then compared with the Bayesian information criterion. The model containing 3 trajectory patterns was found to be the most appropriate. Third, models of different functional forms (eg, 3, cubic; 2, quadratic; and 1, linear) were compared and evaluated according to their significance level, using the highest polynomial trigger. Finally, we had 1 pattern with a linear order term and 2 patterns with up to quadratic order terms, which suits the statistical conditions to construct trajectory patterns, and then performed Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between LE8 trajectories and DKD risk over the period 2006 to 2010. The Cox proportional hazards model with Schoenfeld residuals satisfied the proportional hazards assumption before the model was established.48In addition, the incidence of DKD in different LE8 levels had been examined using log\u2010rank tests. Multivariable analyses were conducted after adjustment for age (years), sex (women or men), income per month (<800 or \u2265800 \u00a5), educational level (elementary school or below, middle school, or high school or above), occupation (coal miners, other blue\u2010collar workers, or white\u2010collar workers), and alcohol consumption (never, abstainer, or current). The trend in risk across the tertile of LE8 was tested by computing these 3 indexes as continuous variables in the fully adjusted model. Moreover, a Cox restricted cubic spline (RCS)\u00a0model with 4 knots (25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles) was used to examine the dose\u2010response effects. We used a piecewise function according to 4 knots to fit each interval, and likelihood ratio tests were conducted to determine the linearity assumption. In addition, we further targeted the 2 potential cut points to define high risk and to separate relatively kidney\u2010health diabetes by visually checking the RCS plot and a series of HRs for LE8 and DKD. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to measure the statistical interaction between potential confounding of DKD risk and LE8 (baseline and trajectory) by comparison of \u22122 log likelihood among nested models with and without the cross\u2010product terms. In addition, a few sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. (1) Stratified analyses were performed on age (<45, 45\u201365, and >65\u2009years), sex (women and men), educational level (elementary school or below, middle school, and high school or above), income (<800 and \u2265800 \u00a5), occupation (coal miners, other blue\u2010collar workers, and white\u2010collar workers), and alcohol consumption (never, abstainer, and current) for the adjusted models. The variables investigated were not adjusted. (2) We reran the SAS program, Proc Traj procedure, to confirm the stability of trajectory patterns after further excluding the participants who had missing data in LE8 during the period 2006 to 2010. (3) We further excluded DKD that took place in the first 2\u2009years of follow\u2010up to scrutinize possibilities of inverse causation. (4) Considering the study population is patients with diabetes, the blood glucose section might vary the primary results. We removed FBG from the total score and reran the primary result. (5) The unmeasured confounding between LE8 and incident DKD was quantified by calculatingE\u2010values49using the \u201cevalue hr\u201d code in Stata. TheE\u2010value represents the minimum magnitude of an unmeasured confounder that could negate the observed association of LE8 and DKD.6We added another sensitivity analysis in which women are removed from the study population because men comprised >85% of the study population.7The pattern of dropout attributable to death is important, which was a significant competing event. Thus, the Fine\u2010Gray models were conducted to account for the competing risk.8Considering the right truncation may pose an impact on the robustness of primary results, we used the follow\u2010up time as the incident time if the participants were diagnosed in the corresponding follow\u2010up rather than using the midpoint and then reran the primary results.9In addition, the missing data of LE8 in 2008 and 2010 were imputed using multiple imputations, using 5 replications and chained equations in Stata. Then, the mean of 5 replications was calculated and used to reanalyze the primary results.

Objective 1.To develop a Swedish short version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for cognitive screening in patients with stroke (s-MoCA-SWE). Two different methods were used to identify the most important MoCA tasks that should be included: principal component analysis (PCA) (24,25) and boosted regression trees (BRT) (26,27). The PCA helps to simplify information by reducing the dimensionality of the data without losing important information. BRT select tasks based on a reference standard instrument, which in this case was the complete MoCA. Objective 1. PCA and BRT each resulted in a working version of a plausible short form: the s-MoCA-SWE/PCA and s-MoCA-SWE/BRT. Patients were then classified to cognitive impairment (no/yes) using separate binary logistic regression models that included the selected MoCA tasks as independent variables (expanded methods). Because the s-MoCA-SWE is a screening tool, greater weight was placed on reducing the number of false-negatives; therefore, sensitivity was used as the primary measure of accuracy (16). Objective 2.To identify the optimal threshold for detecting cognitive impairment and compare the properties of the s-MoCA-SWE with those of previously developed short forms of the MoCA. The threshold for cognitive impairment on the s-MoCA-SWE was achieved by evaluating the coordinate points of the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve. Objective 2. Contingency tables were created for comparing the properties of the s-MoCA-SWE with those of previously developed short forms of the MoCA. A dichotomized s-MoCA-SWE (\u2264 12 points for impaired cognition) was compared against a dichotomized T-MoCA (10), NINDS-CSN (9,11), SF-MoCA (7,8), and the complete MoCA (all at usual diagnostic thresholds). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, Youden\u2019s index, and accuracy (overall probability that a patient is correctly classified) were calculated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each test was evaluated. An AUC value of 0.8\u20130.9 was considered excellent and a value of more than 0.9 was considered outstanding (28).

LME was used in order to take into account the dependency between responses within individuals (one individual provided response regarding several of their adult\u2013child relationships). In all LME analyses, respondent was set as a random factor. First, preliminary analyses investigated whether child gender (female vs. male), child age, respondent age, respondent relationship status (single vs. in relationship but living apart vs. in relationship but living together vs. married), and the number of children in the care of the respondent were associated with willingness to invest. Each variable was included in separate preliminary analyses as fixed factors with willingness to invest (composite score) as outcome variable. Additionally, as the age of the respondent and the age of the child are likely to be associated with one another, we conducted an analysis with both child age and respondent age included as fixed factors in the same model. We also investigated the relationship between coresidence duration and investment in stepchildren. Second, we investigated the difference in the amount of investment between the adult\u2013child relationships. This LME analysis included willingness to invest (composite score) as outcome variable and adult\u2013child relationship (biological child, sister\u2019s child, brother\u2019s child, stepchild, and friend\u2019s child), as a fixed factor, and was followed up with pairwise comparisons. Third, to test whether putative relatedness or psychological kinship estimates (i.e., putative relatedness weighted by certainty in relatedness) explained more variance in willingness to invest, two LME analyses with willingness to invest as outcome variable were run, one with putative relatedness as a fixed factor and another one with psychological kinship estimates as a fixed factor. These models were then compared using an analysis of variance of the two models to examine whether one explained significantly more variance than the other. Fourth, to test for the mediating effects of emotional closeness on the relationship between psychological kinship estimates and willingness to invest, the analyses were conducted stepwise in accordance with a procedure suggested byBaron and Kenny (1986). The stepwise analyses were conducted separately for male and female respondents. To enable comparison of the regression coefficients, all continuous variables were standardized by transforming the values intoz-scores before the stepwise analyses were conducted. Then, the zero-order effect between all three variables of interest was assessed (Step 1\u20133). After this, an analysis including both psychological kinship estimates and emotional closeness as predictors and willingness to invest as the outcome variable was conducted (Step 4). If the zero-order standardized \u03b2 between the predictor (psychological kinship estimates) and the outcome variable (investment) decreases, but remains significant, after inclusion of the mediating variable (emotional closeness), partial mediation is supported. If there no longer is a significant association between the predictor and the outcome variable after including the mediating variable, full mediation is supported. The difference between the zero-order association and the association when the mediating variable is included in the model represents the indirect effect of the predictor variable on the outcome variable via the mediating variable. To test the significance of the indirect effect, theSobel (1982)test was performed by using themediation.testfunction in the R package (version 5.1.6) (Wang, 2015) in R. The Sobel test examines whether the decrease in the effect of the predictor when the mediating variable is introduced in the model is significant.

Both Gwet\u2019s AC1 and Krippendorff\u2019s alpha can be applied to multiple raters performing ratings on ordinal scales. Krippendorff\u2019s alpha has rarely been used in pathology.22However, as pathologists commonly use \u03ba coefficients, we applied several agreement scores to facilitate comparison with previous reproducibility studies within pathology without compromising the required statistical assumptions. To determine the overall level of inter- and intrarater agreement, Krippendorff\u2019s alpha coefficient was calculated, which is applicable to any number of raters (in contrast to Cohen\u2019s \u03ba) and ratings on an ordinal scale (in contrast to Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba).23,24Krippendorff\u2019s alpha and \u03ba scores were compared with Fleiss\u2019/Cohen\u2019s \u03ba coefficients for those analyses meeting the required assumptions. Gwet\u2019s AC1 agreement score has recently been used in pathology25,26and has also been calculated for comparison.27Intrarater agreement score was assessed for 1 pathologist (J.M.) from the coordinating center (assessed on the subset of 80 cases from that center for the first grading round), by comparing the participant\u2019s study diagnosis with the original clinical diagnosis, previously rendered by the same pathologists (wash-out time >4 y in 86% of biopsies, >1 y in 99%, and 1 biopsy with 4-mo wash-out time).

To determine the number of components of these instruments, the method of determining the eigenvalue was used.[27] In this study, to simplify and interpret the factor structures in order to extract the factors, the maximum likelihood method was used, assuming that the data have a natural distribution. To rotate the factors, the Oblique and Promax Rotation (kappa parameter 4) were used, assuming that the factors are inclined and correlated with each other.[23] Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using Amos software - version 22 to determine the fitness of the model.[28] Convergent validity refers to the degree of correlation between scores obtained from two instruments that are theoretically related to each other.[22] In the present study, EHFScBS-9 was used to determine convergent validity with SDS. After determining the normal distribution of data, their scores were compared using the Pearson linear correlation test. The discriminant validity of SDS was evaluated using the known-groups comparison method.[22] In this study, it was assumed that the Persian version of the SDS can differentiate between different NYHA functional classes so that class I has a lower score than class IV HF. In other words, class I patients experience fewer signs and symptoms.[5] A comparison of known groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance by fulfilling the condition of normal distribution and uniformity of variance of the groups. To assess the internal consistency of the scale, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was estimated. Alpha value consistency of 0.8 and above was considered desirable.[22]",

We used model selection with Akaike's information criterion to determine the appropriate correlation and variance structures for each analysis.29Conversely, we used a multivariable generalized linear model30when outcomes were averaged over locations, such as macrophage-like cell density. To identify group differences in NFL axonal bundle, RGC, and macrophage-like cell measures among cohorts of HVs and MS participants with or without a prior history of ON, we conducted multiple comparisons withPvalues adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method. Moreover, we only considered MS participants with or without ON to detect associations with disability and vision measures, and we evaluated differences between HVs and MS participants in the model analyzing associations with RGC by either mean or interaction models. t P Only data from the eye chosen for AO scanning was used for all statistical analyses involving visual outcomes. For associations evaluated between AO-OCT and visual field (VF) measures (e.g., 10-2 VF total deviation), the VF values were interpolated to the AO-OCT location, accounting for the displacement in neural projections from the photoreceptors (i.e., VF location) to the ganglion cells (i.e., AO imaging location), similar to analysis performed in a previous glaucoma study.18Similarly interpolated conventional OCT thickness measures at the same location as each AO-OCT location were used in comparisons between AO-OCT and conventional OCT. All statistical tests were performed using R software, version 4.1.0.

Also, correlations among scale items were reported. Afterwards, we conducted a mediation model. In this model, self-efficacy, positive affect, negative affect, workplace support, ADA knowledge, accommodation knowledge, and work goal were input variables, job satisfaction and job performance were outcome variables, and accommodation receiving status, which was a binary variable and indicated whether or not participants received accommodation, acted as the mediator variable. We ran the factor analyses required for computing coefficient omega and the mediation model in Mplus8.4 [47]. Considering that data of scale items were ordinal, we conducted factor analyses using robust unweighted least squares (ULSMV) method based on Polychoric correlations (i.e., estimates of the relationships between the latent continuous variables underlying the observed ordinal variables). The mediation model was conducted with robust maximum likelihood (MLR) method and integration. With this specification, a logistic regression was used to estimate direct effects from input variables to the binary mediator, while linear regressions were used to estimate direct effects from the mediator to outcome variables. Based on the obtained parameter estimates for the mediation model in Mplus, we manually calculated the indirect effects of input variables on outcome variables via the mediator, using the Delta method proposed by Huang et al.

    "20471": "Variable selection was knowledge driven: literature review and expert opinion were used to select possible predictors for graft function [18]. These predictors were included in a final multivariable logistic regression model with the time after transplantation modeled using restricted cubic splines (Supplementary data, Table S6andTable S8) [19,20]. In the model, the following parameters were included: Recipient age, donor age, LD, pre-emptive transplantation, re-transplantation, number of HLA mismatches, number of HLA-DR mismatches, and primary disease causing kidney failure, and the model was corrected for the decade (era) of transplantation. Parameters such as sex mismatches, duration of dialysis, HLA-DQ mismatches and donor health were excluded because of missing data, and ABO incompatibility was excluded because of its low incidence. Complete-case analysis was performed, with transplantations with missing data for these parameters excluded for this model. Because of the significant changes in protocols over time, a separate analysis was executed for transplantations that were performed after 1990. Eventually, two models were developed. Model 1 including the data from all transplantations with complete data, and Model 2 including the data from all transplantations with complete data transplanted after 1990. A person period file was created in which each month of follow-up was used as an individual observation point [21]. The probability of graft loss was predicted for every patient for every month after transplantation. The effects of the variable \u201cmonths after transplantation\u201d were fitted using restricted cubic splines to allow for nonlinear relationships. Natural splines were used with five knots placed at the quantiles 0.05, 0.275, 0.5, 0.725 and 0.95, as suggested by Harrel [20]. We examined model calibration using smoothed plots of observed versus predicted values (Supplementary data, Fig. S5). As a result, six time-related variables were created, which were used to estimate how graft failure probability develops over the months following transplantation (V1\u2013V6). The hazard for graft failure was calculated for each patient at a given time point after transplantation according to the \u03b2-regression coefficients estimated from this final logistic model. These hazards were used to calculate the predicted survival, which was used to draw a survival curve for each patient based on the available parameters.",

To validate more refined segmentation targets such as calcified lesions and individually segmented leaflets, we further used the Hausdorff distance-95% (HD-95) and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) to measure the geometric similarity between the ground truth and predicted results. We used the Euclidean distance to validate the consistency of the spatial coordinates of specific anatomical positions automatically located by the algorithm and manually located by experienced observers. The specific anatomical positions referred specifically to the BHPs and the inferior margins of the LCAO and RCAO.

P The mortality rates were estimated for both thyroid cancer and competing causes by dividing the number of deaths by the person-years. When modeling survival data in the presence of competing risks, the traditional Kaplan\u2013Meier survival function can lead to upward-biased estimates (13); therefore, we used the cumulative incidence functions to estimate the mortality risk of thyroid cancer over time, with deaths from other causes being incorporated as competing risk. We conducted these analyses both for the overall cohort and by detection route and age group (<55 and \u226555 years). To explore the impact of detection route and other potential risk factors on thyroid cancer and competing mortality, we used the cause-specific hazard models instead of subdistribution hazard models, considering that the regression coefficients from the former models can be interpreted as the effect of the risk factors on the relative increase in mortality rates, which is more appropriate for addressing etiological questions (12). Univariable analyses were conducted for each factor, and then those factors withP< 0.10 were further included in the multivariable analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) of incidental detection on thyroid cancer and competing mortality were estimated after adjusting for potential confounders. We applied the multiple imputation approach by chained equations to impute missing values (14), which ranged from 0.1% (smoking status) to 14.3% (BMI) among the included variables.

Since the proportional hazard assumption was not fulfilled, separate associations were studied within intervals of gestational age at birth to determine the hazard ratio of giving birth in each interval according to the level of life stress or emotional distress. The intervals were as follows: very or moderate preterm (27\u201333\u2009weeks), late preterm (34\u201336\u2009weeks), early term (37\u201338\u2009weeks), full term (39\u201341\u2009weeks) and post\u2010term (42\u201345\u2009weeks).

If the exposure period of a prescription covered the outcome or reference dates, this date was considered exposed. Using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method [22], we hereby obtained the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with being exposed on the outcome date, but not on a reference date. This \u2018fixed dates\u2019 approach was preferred over a \u2018fixed windows\u2019 approach. Where the former uses one outcome date and several reference dates, the latter stacks windows of fixed lengths backwards in time from the outcome date. These windows are then considered exposed if there is a filled prescription within them. The fixed dates approach was chosen for two reasons. First, it allowed for flexibility in estimating exposure lengths. Second, it provided a clearer exposure definition, as the outcome and reference dates were only considered exposed if an exposure period covered that date. We ensured a washout period by having a greater gap between the outcome date and the most recent reference date (120 days) than between the reference dates themselves (60 days). Because each individual serves as his/her own control, the case-crossover design eliminates confounding by covariates that are stable over time (e.g., genetics).

We first ran univariate models to explore potential effects and trends for each variable considered. Next, we ran two sets of multivariate models. In the first one, using the entire data set (n= 521 nestlings), we included the following explanatory variables: the nestling age at banding, the hatching date, the breeding nucleus where it was born, the nest substrate, the method used to determine the sex of the individual, and the availability of food according to the mad-cow crisis stage (seeTable 1for details). All models included the year as a random factor. In the second set of models, we took advantage of the more detailed information collected for the Riaza nucleus (n= 332 nestlings) to further explore the effects of the nestling age, the hatching date, the parental age, the conspecific density, the annual reproductive success, the annual mean laying date, the sexing method, and the availability of food according to the mad-cow crisis stage (seeTable 1for details). Year was included as a random factor. As parental age information was not available for all nestlings, we used two different datasets including all nestlings and only those of parents of known age. Note that the identity of the parents was not available to control for their effect on nestling sex.

If temperature-dependent fluorescence occurs in the no-protein samples, we do not proceed with analysis. Instead, we optimize the DSF conditions to reduce protein-independent fluorescence (i.e., seetroubleshooting 1).b.If the no-protein control does not reveal artifactual fluorescence, qualitatively assess the shape of the raw data curves. Qualitative assessments include how many transitions are visually apparent and their approximate steepness, and the presence of undesirable fluorescent signal at pre-unfolding temperatures (Table 9). Seeexpected outcomes.c.If no unexpected changes in curve shape are observed, note features of the curve to help inform the approach taken to Tma quantification.

Seeexpected outcomesandquantification and statistical analysis. Tma is calculated from raw DSF curves using either of two general approaches: first derivative or sigmoid fitting. These methods don\u2019t represent conflicting interpretations of DSF data; rather, they are different mathematical approaches to extracting the mid-point of a sigmoidal transition. A common approach is to calculate Tmas is by fitting raw DSF curves to a Boltzmann sigmoid using general software packages, such as GraphPad Prism. This approach is widely used, simple, and requires no specialized tools. However, it typically requires truncating the raw DSF data at its maximum value to remove the post-peak decrease (Figures\u00a03A and 3B).\u2022Data analysis softwares. Data analysis softwares.

Adjustment variables included age at waitlist registration, gender, race (white, black, or other), duration of diabetes (years from the date of diabetes onset to date of waitlist registration), body mass index (BMI), Karnofsky functional status score, and presence of peripheral vascular disease (yes or no). BMI and functional status were divided into common clinically relevant groups operationalized into categorical variables. Adjustment variables were not considered as time-varying. Adjusted Cox models comparing survival after transplant between transplant-type groups only included transplanted patients and time from transplant to death or censoring. Additional models for up to 90 d post-transplant, 91 to 365 d post-transplant, and over 1 year post-transplant were also performed to compare survival within each period between transplant-type groups. These models were adjusted for the same variables as the previous set of models, with the addition of years on the waitlist. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported[17].

Public Exposure and Responses to Data Breaches As the ANU data does not deal specifically with healthcare, when seeking to focus on LAHP figures the peak Australian data comes via the Commonwealth Privacy Act's Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme, which is overseen by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

While this shows for each year that healthcare has reported significant breach volumes (and that human error is consistently the main cause at 462/929 (49.9%) of all breaches), it should also be noted these figures are likely to be significantly under-reported for the following reasons:Not all LAHPs have a mandatory reporting requirement under this Commonwealth legislation (such as state-run public health services), and so several very large LAHPs are excluded from these figures.The Commonwealth Government's Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA) reports separately on data breaches or incidents impacting the national My Health Record system, and those figures are also excluded here.For LAHPs that are covered under these Privacy Act reporting requirements, not all data breaches are considered \u2018eligible\u2019 for inclusion into these periodic reports, and are also excluded here.

This study evaluated the effect of DIP policy intervention from the perspective of drug utilization. The ITS model was applied to evaluate the impact of DIP policy intervention on drug costs and medication structure of patients. ITS is a commonly used method to evaluate the changes in longitudinal sequence after quasi-trial intervention at a fixed time point.10The time when Guangzhou implemented the DIP policy in January 2018 is considered the intervention time point of ITS analysis. We utilized a piecewise regression model of baseline trend control to estimate the level and trend change of each outcome variable after DIP policy intervention. The assumption of model specification was that the introduction of DIP policy intervention would affect the drug cost and medication structure of inpatients, and ITS regression model constructed was as follows: Yt=\u03b20+\u03b21\u00d7Tt+\u03b22\u00d7Interventiont+\u03b23\u00d7Timeafterinterventiont+\u03b5t Ytwas the outcome variable. \u03b20was the estimated value of the outcome variable baseline level at the beginning of the study; \u03b21was the slope before intervention; \u03b22was the immediate level change of outcome variables after intervention; \u03b23was the long-term trend of outcome variables after intervention; Ttwas the time counting variable; Interventiontwas the intervention indicator variable; Timeafterinterventiontwas the time counting variable after intervention;\u03b5twas the estimated value of the random error at time t.

Gender, residence and marital status-stratified analyses were further conducted. Before mediation analysis, the correlation between intrafamilial ACEs and social ACEs was examined using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, and the variance inflation factors (VIFs) were also calculated to assess potential collinearity issues. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was 0.27 (<0.40), and the VIFs for intrafamilial ACEs and social ACEs were 1.10 and 1.09, respectively. Also, the VIFs of all other variables were less than 10, suggesting no severe collinearity. Subsequently, the mediating role of social ACEs in the associations of intrafamilial ACEs with depressive symptoms and cognitive function (global cognition, episodic memory and mental intactness), as well as the education-moderated mediating role of social ACEs in these associations, was explored based on the \u2018mediation\u2019 package in R. For instance, the equations for exploring the mediating role of social ACEs between intrafamilial ACEs and depressive symptoms were as follows: Model 1: Social ACEs=Intrafamilial ACEs+Covariates (ordered logistic regression) Model 2: Depressive symptoms=Intrafamilial ACEs+Social ACEs+Covariates (binary logistic regression) Reporting of this study was done under the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

The rationale for establishing these 2 time periods were to represent baseline (pre-Cures Act changes) and post-Cures Act changes. We excluded 2 months from the statistical analysis (December 10, 2020\u2013February 8, 2021), as this timeframe saw extensive education and marketing related to the upcoming changes that may have impacted viewing. However, we included this interim 2-month timeframe in all the figures that depict changes over time. In all analyses, we excluded 49\u202f879 tests of 8101 patients due to unknown or conflicting demographic information. Among patients with active MyChart accounts, generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to model the probability of whether a test result/report was viewed over time. Estimates were obtained for 2 timeframes, viewing within 1 day and within 30 days from portal release. The GEE was clustered on patient such that the correlation between the viewing of any 2 tests from the same patient was assumed to be constant. To account for any potential trend over time in patient results review, time (in months) was included as a covariate. An indicator variable to denote the time after February 2021 was also included to capture the impact of the Cures Act on the trend. This approach allowed us to analyze changes in the trend of patients results viewing before and after the implementation of the Cures Act. Additionally, patients\u2019 demographics and test characteristics were included as covariates.

In that study, the average SWV measurement before chemotherapy was 2.85 m/s, and the average difference in SWV values before and after chemotherapy was 0.17 m/s. Assuming a type I error of 0.05, a type II error of 0.20, and a standard deviation of 0.25, a minimum of 33 participants were required. The response rate of CRLM to first-line chemotherapy has been reported to range from 48%-54% [22,23]. With an assumed 50% response rate for CRLM and a 12% drop-out rate, the final sample size was calculated to be 75.

Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset, which included all randomized patients who received at least one study drug dose. Data collected more than 45 days after the last dose of the study drug were not included in the efficacy analyses. Efficacy data from the ITT dataset were analysed by treatment group assignment at the time of randomization, regardless of whether the patient received the correct treatment, was compliant with the protocol, or followed through with the study until completion. Interim efficacy analyses were also performed when 8 patients/group, 35 patients/group, and 55 patients/group, respectively, completed the Week 96 visit. The safety dataset included all randomized patients who received at least one study drug dose; however, safety analyses from the safety dataset were performed by actual treatment received rather than treatment assignment at the time of randomization. The primary efficacy analysis used a likelihood-based, mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline for each postbaseline visit using all observed data. The model included fixed, categorical effects for treatment, site, visit, Treatment \u00d7 Visit interaction, and Baseline \u00d7 Visit interaction with a continuous fixed covariate for baseline score. Satterthwaite\u2019s approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom and the type III sum-of-squares for the least squares (LS) means was used to estimate treatment group differences. The MMRM analysis was also used to analyse secondary and exploratory variables. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for CDR-SB score subgroup analysis and CSF biomarkers for each scheduled visit. Owing to non-symmetry in the probability distribution, logarithmic transformation was employed on plasma and CSF biomarkers. Two sensitivity data analyses were performed on the primary efficacy end point, one excluding patients who did not meet the study selection criteria and missed or were underdosed for >2 doses; and the other excluding those who did not meet the study selection criteria and including those who had any available CDR-SB score, including patients who missed doses and those who completed a final assessment >45 days after the last dose. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation applied separately for each treatment group. An external data monitoring committee was responsible for reviewing unblinded safety data after every 12th patient in Cohort 1 received their second dose of tilavonemab and had their MRI results available (approximately 2 weeks after the second dose). The committee also reviewed unblinded safety data after a total of approximately 100, 200, 300, and 400 patients were randomized, and every 6 months thereafter until study completion.

To create the nomogram, we initially conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify the optimal combination of independent prognostic factors for predicting OS, and to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The calculations were done on the training cohort of the ACT-excluded sample. Demographic and tumor-related factors that were significantly associated with OS in the univariate analysis were included into the multivariate analysis. A nomogram for predicting the OS at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years was established based on the results of multivariate Cox regression in the training cohort. To assess the predictive accuracy of the nomogram, we created receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. The calibration curves were generated by contrasting the nomogram\u2019s predicted probabilities with the actual probabilities through bootstrapping with 500 resamples to verify the nomogram\u2019s performance. The closer the curve is to the ideal curve, the better the predictive power of the nomogram. Additionally, we computed the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the model\u2019s performance. The larger the AUC, the higher the accuracy. We used the total points generated by the nomogram as risk scores and drew boxplots based on different clinicopathological factors to visualize the distribution of risk scores. In order to evaluate the predictive ability of our model on the benefit of ACT, we included patients who received ACT after radical surgery, referred to as the ACT-included sample, in our follow-up analysis. We performed multivariate Cox regression in the ACT-included sample to test whether ACT is a risk factor for patients with T1-2N0-1M0 NSCLC after radical surgery. We classified patients in both ACT-excluded and ACT-included samples into 2 risk groups (low-risk and high-risk groups) according to the risk score\u2019s best cut-off point. In the ACT-included sample, patients from each risk group at stage IB and IIA were categorized into two cohorts (control and ACT cohorts) according to their chemotherapy status. Finally, OS of patients from 2 cohorts in each risk group were compared. We used R software (version 4.1.0;http://www.r-project.org) for all data analyses and X-tile software (version 3.6.1, Yale University, USA) to calculate optimal cut-off points.29We entered the patient\u2019s risk scores, survival time, and survival status into the X-tile software and ran the program to obtain the result.29A two-sidedPvalue <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

(2009). This index was separately calculated for each tract of interest across each DTI metric at each timepoint. Group trajectories of lateralization indices for each tract across each metric were constructed using FPCA (Yao et\u00a0al. 2005). Given the possibility that lateralization processes may be time-varying from 0 to 6\u00a0months, we implemented a nonparametric statistical approach that places few assumptions on the shape of the group trajectory. FPCA is an extension of Functional Data Analysis specifically designed to accommodate sparsely sampled longitudinal data, i.e. data sampled intermittently over a given time period and with missing data points (Yao et\u00a0al. 2005). Using Principal Components Analysis by Conditional Expectation (PACE), a data-driven, nonparametric curve-fitting algorithm, FPCA constructs nonlinear trajectories at the group and individual level. Mean growth curves of white matter lateralization were built for 9 major white matter tracts and WB white matter using the PACE package, version 2.17, in MATLAB R2019b. Simultaneous 95% confidence bands for both the mean curves and rate of change curves were computed using bootstrapped data, resampled with replacement at the individual level over 1,000 iterations. This approach is robust to noise in individual data as it models variance within the sample across the entire trajectory. For this reason, simultaneous confidence bands are the gold standard for constructing confidence bands because, when compared with pointwise confidence intervals, which evaluate variability for each unit of time (in this case, days), they are more conservative and accurate. Areas of the trajectory where the confidence bands do not include 0 denoted time periods of significant lateralization; leftward where the value was positive and rightward where the value was negative. The rate of change of lateralization was determined by taking the first derivative of the group trajectory, and periods of significant lateralization velocity were again denoted by regions where bootstrapped simultaneous confidence intervals did not include 0. To assess the potential effect of infant sex on patterns of white matter lateralization, we took 2 approaches. First, we split the sample into males and females and constructed sex-specific trajectories. Sex differences were measured as time periods when the confidence bands for male and female trajectories for each tract did not overlap. Considering that halving our sample size, from categorizing infants by sex, can make confidence bands less reliable since coverage decreases across the experimental window, we used a second, complimentary approach to test for sex effects. Variance in individual trajectory shapes relative to the group mean can be assessed using principal component (PC) functions and corresponding PC scores (Yao et\u00a0al. 2005). Thus, we compared the PC scores of males and females for the components derived from the trajectory of each tract using 2-tailed Student\u2019st-tests. t",

Tumor-level genotype proportions were computed by aggregating (adding) data from all images in a particular tumor. Spearman correlations between proportions (Figures 3EandS3C) were computed based on tumor-level proportions using the R Hmisc package, with p values FDR-adjusted for multiple comparisons. Best-fit lines shown inFigure 3Ewere obtained with an inverse (y = a/x + b) curve fit (Python SciPy) (top panels; negative Spearman coefficient) and linear fits (Python NumPy polyfit) (bottom panels; positive Spearman coefficient). Computation of minimum relative distances (Figure 4G) was done by calculating in each imagei, for each cellcof genotypeG, the Euclidean distancedG,G(c)to the nearest cell of the genotypeG\u2032and the Euclidean distancedG,G\u2032(c)to the nearest cell of any genotype. The average minimum relative distance for genotypeGand genotypeG\u2032(where we also considerG=G\u2032) in imageiis then given by\u2329RG,i\u232a=\u2329dG,G(c)dG,G\u2032(c)\u232ac\u2208Ci,GwhereCi,Gis the set of all cells of genotypeGin imagei. Computation of clustering properties proceeded by implementing k-means clustering (Python scikit-learn) in each imageifor all cellsc\u2208Ci,G. The optimal number of clusters (from 2 to 5) was selected by finding the highest Silhouette score. The total sum of squares (TSS) was computed as Euclidean distances between allc\u2208Ci,Gand the mean ofc,c\u2208Ci,G. The between cluster sum of squares (BCSS) was then computed as the difference between the TSS and the within cluster sum of squares, as given by the inertia property of the clusters obtained. BCSS/TSS represents the ratio of the between cluster sum of squares to the total sum of squares and provides a measure for the tightness of clustering of each genotype, with a higher ratio indicating tighter clustering. TERT g g HER2 i The Shannon diversity index for copy number diversity in each individual image (Figure 4F) was calculated on a tumor level, after aggregating all the images in that tumor. The frequency of each copy number in the relevant cell type (e.g., E cells) was divided by the total number of cells of that type, and then the sum over those was taken. For a cell type \\omega that would be \\sum_{\\omega copy number}\\frac{frequency of copy number}{total number of \\omega cells}. The odds ratio ofEGFRandCDK4co-amplification (EC genotype) is given by the odds of a cell being co-amplified given that it is amplified inEGFRrelative to the odds of a cell being co-amplified given that it is not amplified inOR=(NEC\u2215NE)\u2215(NC\u2215NN\u2215O), whereNis the number of cells with a given genotype. The OR is calculated as follows: EGFR CDK4 EGFR The odds ratio of a CDK4 amplification in a cell if EGFR is amplified in a cell is given byOA=NEC\u2215(NEC+NE)1\u2212NEC\u2215(NEC+NE) And the odds of a CDK4 amplification inna cell if EGFR is not amplified in a cell is given byON=NC\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O)1\u2212NC\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O) So that the odds ratio ofEGFRandCDK4co-amplification is given byOR=OAON=NEC\u2215(NEC+NE)1\u2212NEC\u2215(NEC+NE)NC\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O)1\u2212NC\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O)=NEC\u2215(NEC+NE)NE\u2215(NEC+NE)NC\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O)NN\u2215O\u2215(NC+NN\u2215O)=NEC\u2215NENC\u2215NN\u2215O EGFR CDK4 The OR was computed in each tumor separately by combining data from all images in the tumor (Figure 4A). For subsequent analysis, tumors were divided based on their computed OR into tertiles representing low-OR (ORlow), middle-OR, and high-OR (ORhigh) tumors. To determine statistical significance of distributional differences between the top and bottom tertiles in across the various covariates tested, Mann-Whitney tests (Python SciPy) were employed. Associated proteomic analysis (Figures 5Aand5B) employed tumor-level expression data, processed as described above. Separate analyses were carried out on clinical and proteomics data from Wang et al.40(Figure 5D) and on clinical and mRNA expression levels (U133 microarray;Figure 5E) TCGA Firehose Legacy dataset. In each case, clinical data was combined with CD163 expression data to fit a Cox proportional hazard model (Breslow\u2019s method), adjusted for patient age and sex, and compute a 95% CI. IDH-mutant tumors were excluded from the analysis. The Python lifelines package was used to fit the model, obtain Kaplan-Meier curves, and perform a log rank test. Single cell CNA were inferred from two different scRNAseq datasets: Richards et al.16and Neftel et al.,15using the inferCNV R package v.1.3. Data from both studies was downloaded from the Single Cell Portal maintained by the Broad Institute, together with sample metadata, including cell type assignment, as follows: normalized expression values log2(TPM/10 + 1) for Neftel et al.15and UMI counts for Richards et al.16 inferCNV was ran separately for the malignant cells of each patient with a standard window size of 100, and with the following parameters: HMM = true, HMM_type = \u2018i3\u2019, cluster_by_groups = TRUE, denoise = TRUE, analysis_mode = subcluster. For Neftel et al.,15cutoff = 1 was employed (this data was generated with the SmartSeq2 technology), while for Richards et al.,16cutoff = 0.1 was used (data generated with 10X Genomics). inferCNV employs a 3-state Hidden Markov Model, inferring neutral regions, amplifications, and deletions. Reference cell types were set to Macrophages, Oligodendrocytes and T cells on the Neftel et al.,15and to Immune and Normal Brain on the data in Richards et al.16Both datasets were assessed for the copy number status of EGFR and CDK4. On the Richards et al.16data, a Seurat object73was created, with keeping only genes expressed in at least 10 cells, and only cells that express at least 200 features. Further, cells for which more than 20% of the transcriptome was encoded by mitochondrial genes were removed (43,177 cells analyzed). The data was preprocessed following the standard Seurat scRNAseq workflow, including normalizing with SCTransform, running PCA, constructing the nearest neighbor graph from the top 30 PC components, and further constructing the 2D UMAP representation. Cell types were assigned as non-immune, M1 and M2 macrophages, and T cells, using heatmaps with expression of canonical markers,74and expression scores of M1 and M2 macrophages (Tables S6andS7). This amounted to 16,629 cells classified as non-immune, 1,484 cells as T-cells, 18,134 as M1, and 6,920 as M2 macrophages. This assignment matched very well with the provided annotation classifying cells into immune and non-immune.",

To establish relevant differences between T\u00a0cell responses stimulated by wild type and mutated peptides we applied anEffect sizecalculation.60Fold changes can be assimilated to Risk Ratios (RR) for which their use as \"effect size\" measures has been suggested in the literature. Effect size reveals how relevant is the relationship between variables or the difference between groups. Measures of effect size are usually divided into \"small effect\", \"medium effect\" and \"large effect\". A large effect size means that a research finding has practical significance, while a small effect size indicates limited practical implications. For our data we chose the \"large effect\" threshold (RR\u00a0= 3.0), as the discriminant for the most important values. Taking the logarithm of this value, we defined the corresponding thresholds in the log scale (0.48). Specifically, for each T\u00a0cell response stimulated by a mutant pool, we calculated the fold-change relative to the ancestral pool (mutated/wild-type).

A correlation analysis was further performed to assess the relationship between metabolite concentration and frequency of MDMA use within MDMA users, as well as to estimate consistency between GLX quantification of PRESS/MEGA-PRESS and MEGAdiff/MEGAoff. All correlation coefficients reflect robust estimates based on the approach described above. All tests were 2-tailed, and an alpha-level of 5% was used.

C. elegans As only the 3\u2019 end of the transcript was retained during library preparation, we normalized the counts into Count Per Million (CPM) for each gene. ~8000 genes were detected at a threshold of 1 CPM (Figure S1B), which is comparable to similar RNA-seq performed on single embryonic cells.66We further subsampled the SAM files at varied ratios (10%\u201390%) to confirm sufficient sequencing depth for maximal gene detection.

Following alignment and sorting of BAM files, we performed library complexity analysis using picard. The analysis showed a very high percentage of duplicate reads (over 90% in almost all cells), indicating potential library over-sequencing, which could be due to initially low cDNA load, type of cell sequenced, or could be protocol-specific. Removing duplicates from paired-end reads is generally more effective due to the lower probability of incorrectly marking non-duplicate reads as duplicates and can have significant effects on differential expression analysis. Correctly identified duplicates lead to a reduced amount of noise due to PCR amplification. Incorrect identification of duplicates can reduce the number of significantly expressed genes, especially for highly expressed genes.

In our primary analysis, we fit a cause\u2010specific hazard regression model to compare the rate of new incident hypertension between the heart disease and comparison groups. As competing risks were present, cause\u2010specific hazard regression models were used. The covariates for each model included heart disease status, complications during the index pregnancy (any hypertensive disorders [gestational hypertension or preeclampsia/eclampsia], any nonhypertension obstetric complications [obstetric hemorrhage, placental abruption/infarction, premature delivery, poor fetal growth, or stillbirth], any cardiac complication [heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, or myocardial infarction]), baby with congenital heart defect during index pregnancy, Charlson comorbidity index,33and the baseline demographic variables used in matching (age and fiscal year of index birth, any births before index birth, residence in Toronto metropolitan area, income quintile). Hypertensive and nonhypertensive obstetric complications, cesarean delivery, and congenital heart disease in the baby were included as covariates due to their relationship to subsequent cardiovascular disease in the general population.4,34,35,36Prior renal disease, prior diabetes or gestational diabetes were also included as covariates due to their known relationship to development of hypertension. Demographic variables used in the matching process (age at index birth, fiscal year of index birth, any births before index birth, residence in metropolitan area, income quintile) were included to adjust for residual confounding. The model also included 2 time\u2010varying covariates for births subsequent to the index pregnancy (currently pregnant; number of births after the index birth), to adjust for the possible influence of subsequent pregnancies on the outcome. The number of physician visits after the 90\u2009days post index birth until the last follow\u2010up, or up to but not including the visit in which hypertension was diagnosed, was included as a time varying covariate, to adjust for the anticipated greater frequency of physician visits in the heart disease group. Physician visits associated with or subsequent to diagnosis of hypertension were not included. We evaluated whether the hazard ratio (HR) associated with the exposure of interest (heart disease group) met the proportional hazards assumption. The level of significance was set at 0.05 (2\u2010sided). We repeated the above procedure by using CARPREG, CARPREG II, and World Health Organization risk groups in place of the heart disease group variable.

Incident hypertension diagnosed before the occurrence of any secondary outcome was incorporated as a time\u2010varying variable. As the occurrence of new hypertension can occur at any time during follow\u2010up, we also use a landmark analysis approach to illustrate the relationship between new hypertension and subsequent death or cardiovascular events based on a cutoff period (landmark); we excluded patients who died or experienced any cardiovascular event before the landmark time.37 Adjusted cumulative incidence curves were generated from the Cox or Fine\u2010Gray model (if death was not included as an outcome); time\u2010varying covariates were not included in these models as cumulative incidence functions cannot be estimated if they are included.38Cumulative incidence curves were truncated at the time of follow\u2010up beyond which the total number of patients at risk was \u226420% of the baseline.

For curve detection, we distinguished the patients from healthy controls according to the normal range of CA (CA\u00a0<10\u00b0). To evaluate the severity grading and curve type classification performance of our deep learning model, five statistical measurements were calculated, including sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), precision (Pr), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (Acc) according to the following equations:(3)Sn=TPTP+FN,(4)Sp=TNTN+FP,(5)Pr=TPTP+FN,(6)NPV=TPTP+FN,(7)Acc=TP+TNTP+FP+TN+FN,where TP, TN, FP, and FN refer to true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, respectively. All statistical analysis were done using Python (v3.8) and several python packages, including Numpy (v1.18.5), SciPy (v1.5.2), Ptitprince (v0.2.6), pandas (v1.1.3), seaborn (v0.11.0), and Matplotlib (v3.3.2). The sub-sampling sample size determination method (SSDM) was used to examine how sample size affects our two models. Unfortunately, SSDM's application to deep learning in medical imaging is still in its early stages, and there is no suitable SSDM to the problem studied in this research. As a result, we chose a practical SSDM, i.e., a curve-fitting method,33in this paper to empirically assess the model's effectiveness at various sample size proportions. The training data was randomly sub-sampled by a proportion factor of 4%, 8%, 16%, 32%, 64%, 100%, and for each factor, the models were trained 10 times (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S8andSupplementary Fig.\u00a0S9). For each training run, the weights from the training history with the minimal validation loss were stored and then assessed on the prospective testing dataset, yielding 10 test loss estimates for each proportion factor (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S10). For both deep learning models, with the increasing training samples, the model performance improved. For the landmark detection model, sampling proportion should be larger than 32% to ensure the model performance and stability while for the RCI synthesis model, all training samples should be used to achieve the best model performance.",

As the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression is a statistical technique that selects the most important predictive factors, the method is suitable for regression of high-dimensional data. We performed Lasso logistic regression in the training set using the \u201cglmnet\u201d package.[19]The dependent variable in the model was hypertension, whereas the independent variables included continuous predictors (age and body mass index [BMI]) and categorical predictors (ethnicity, gender, current residence, marital status, educational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, annual income, heart rate, and FHH). Dummy variables were created for categorical variables. Using the features selected by the Lasso method, a multivariable binary logistic regression model was applied to develop a diagnostic model for hypertension in the training set. To provide the clinician with a quantitative tool to predict the individual probability of hypertension, a nomogram was constructed based on multivariable logistic analysis using the \u201crms\u201d package.[20]Subsequently, the calculated probabilities of individuals in the training set were classified into three risk levels (low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk) based on the two cutoff points determined by the \u201cfindcut\u201d function.[21]Furthermore, a simple and user-friendly website was developed to calculate the individualized risk of hypertension based on the \u201cDynnom\u201d package.[22] Harrell's C-index was calculated among predicted and actual outcomes to evaluate the discriminatory abilities. The model was subjected to bootstrapping validation (1000 bootstrap resamples) to estimate a relative corrected C-index. To estimate calibration, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was performed.[23]To identify the ranges of the probability of miscalibration in the model, the GiViTI calibration belts (see more details in Supplementary Materials) were plotted using the \u201c givitiR\u201d package, together with its statistical confidence (80% and 95%).[24] Discrimination and calibration were also taken into account to estimate the validity of the model in internal and external validation sets. The logistic regression model formed in the training set was applied to all participants of validation sets, and the probability for each individual was calculated. Logistic regressions in validation sets were performed using the probabilities as the independent or dependent factor. Finally, the C-indexes and GiViTI calibration belts were derived based on the regression analyses. In addition, the internal validation set was split into two sets (Han and Yugur) by ethnicity to validate the performance of the model in Han or Yugur people separately. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model, decision curve analysis was conducted by quantifying the net benefits (NBs) at different threshold probabilities in validation datasets using the \u201crmda\u201d package. The NB were calculated using the following formula[16]:Netbenefit=(true-positivecounts)/n\u2212(false-positivecounts)/n)[pt/(1\u2212pt)] where thetrue-andfalse-positive countsare the number of participants with true- and false-positive results,nis the total number of participants, andptis the threshold probability where the expected benefit of treatment is equal to the expected benefit of avoiding treatment. Considering the specific difficulty of NB is that it is in units of B, and the maximum NB is prevalence (P), it motivates the metric standardized NB, sNB\u200a=\u200aNB/P, also known as the relative utility.[15]Because the sNB always has a maximum value of 1.0, providing a sense of large and small on a percent scale, sNB is slightly easier to interpret than NB. true- false-positive counts n pt Duet al[14]developed a diagnostic prediction model for hypertension based on a cross-sectional study in Northern China in 2018. To determine whether our model had a better performance, we calculated the probabilities in training, internal, and external validation sets using Du's and our model separately, and then evaluated the differences of area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) by performing the DeLong's test. et al Two-sidedPvalue <0.05 was considered as statistical significance.

Univariate analysis was applied to each demographic, preoperative and intraoperative characteristic, where the LLA was taken as the dependent variable. Results identify single characteristics that were associated with the LLA in a statistically significant way. Explaining the LLA by multiple characteristics using multivariate linear regression analysis necessitated limiting the analysis to a subset of all characteristics shown hereafter to be independent variables (\u2018the full model\u2019), where LLA was taken as the dependent variable. The variables independency was required for minimizing potential collinearity, and implemented by calculating Pearson correlation coefficientrbetween all possible pairs of the continuous characteristics, keeping only characteristics for which |r|<0.45 when paired with any other characteristic. Handling this elimination process for a group of characteristics, in which each member was correlated by |r|\u22650.45 with at least one other group member, for example SBP, DBP, MAP and PP, is described in the Supplemental Results. r r r Identification of independent characteristics that may explain the LLA in a statistically significant way (\u2018single predictors\u2019) was achieved by applying to the full model of independent characteristics a multivariate linear regression procedure using a backward elimination technique with a enter/removePvalue of 0.05. The group of independent characteristics from the full model, not identified as single predictors by this procedure, were used for adjustment (\u2018adjustors group\u2019) when calculating hazard ratios. P In accordance with the study objective, we generated new predictors, which were expected to be superior to single predictors in explaining LLA. This was done by generating new variables, each representing a different combination of all the single predictors, called hereafter \u2018composite predictors\u2019. In this study, we defined and evaluated two such predictors: an additive LLA predictor X (\u2018COMP_sum\u2019) defined by the outcome of the multivariate linear regression with the backward elimination, being LLA\u200a=\u200a\u03b1+\u03b2\u00b7X, where X is a weighted sum of all the single predictors X1, X2, X3\u2026, and a multiplicative LLA predictor (\u2018COMP_mult\u2019) generated by multiplying all the single predictors, for example X1\u00b7X2\u00b7X3\u00b7\u2026 Logistic regression was applied for determining the odds ratio (OR) of a binary outcome equals 1 for MAP<LLA and 0 for MAP\u2265LLA, as associated with a \u2018binary risk\u2019 defined using the median level of a single or composite LLA predictors (\u2018Median\u2019), equals 1 and 0 for Predictor<Median and Predictor\u2265Median, respectively. With these definitions, we assume that the LLA and any of its tested predictors are negatively correlated. The ORs of the single or and composite predictors was reported both unadjusted, and adjusted to the adjustors group, thus establishing a sensitivity test for the effect of the adjustment. We also calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) that measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between a MAP<LLA and a MAP\u2265LLA using the predictors.

Hence, a filter function was applied to exclude these artefacts (17 starting data points). Subsequently, Pearson's \u03c72Test [35] was used to evaluate if the observed frequency of disorientation instances differed between locations (i.e., non-crossing, crossing), and between groups (i.e., older control, older experimental). To determine if there were differences between groups for the distribution of gender, the Pearson's \u03c72test was equally applied. Differences in age, education years, MMSE score, and all outcome variables between participant groups were evaluated using independent samplettests. Using the R package VCD, the reliability of the video annotations between the 2 annotators (i.e., inter-rater reliability) was assessed based on the Cohen's kappa, which in comparison to percent agreement, is especially robust against agreement by chance [36]. We used R (R Core Team, 2018) and the package lme4 [37] to perform linear mixed effects analysis of the relationship between all gait and psychophysiological parameters (as outcome variables), orientation, location, and group, with age and sex included as covariates. The interaction between orientation and location, as well as orientation and group, were fitted as fixed effects and the intercepts for subjects as random effects. The models were fitted in a step-wise manner, first, with orientation and the covariates included in thebaseline model, and subsequently, with orientation, location, group, and the covariates included in thefinal model. Considering that the model residuals were slightly skewed, we followed up with 100 bootstrap replications using the LMERESAMPLER package [38] to ascertain the robustness of the findings. Subsequently, we performed sensitivity analyses whereby the mixed effects models and bootstrap simulations mentioned previously were refitted, with the exception that 3 remnant outlier data points (assessed based on QQ plots of residuals) were excluded to ascertain if they had a considerable effect on the model outcomes. The sensitivity analyses were only performed in the case whereby the final models showed significant effects. In total, 96.2% of the data was retained after excluding outliers.

The reads were then trimmed and merged (PEAR)48if they overlapped by at least 25\u00a0bp and with a minimum length of the assembled sequences of 25. The QualityFilterFastQ.py script49was applied to eliminate reads with 5 bases below the quality threshold of 15. The reads were then aligned to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (hg19) and to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)71with BWA50with minimum mapping quality set at 25. Duplicates were removed by using DeDup.51Damage patterns among the ancient reads were tracked and quantified (fragmentation and misincorporation patterns) by using mapDamage.52 Contamination estimates based on mtDNA data were inferred for all samples by using schmutzi.53Only for male individuals, contamination estimates were also made based on X chromosome data, using the method implemented in ANGSD (Analysis of next generation Sequencing Data54) (not applicable to females). However, for one male (sample 2430), contamination estimate was not possible due to the low number of reads on X chromosome. To identify degraded DNA sequences that are unlikely originated from modern contamination, human reads of contaminated samples based on estimates on mtDNA data (2277 and 2429) were filtered by using the PMDtools method implemented in.56As a result, sample 2277 was excluded from the study (due to the very low number of reads left after filtering) while the reads after filtering for sample 2429 were used for the analyses (Table\u00a0SM1). The individuals were genotyped at each SNP using the reads with a minimum base and mapping quality of 30 with thebcftools mpileupprogram.55Then, a pseudo-haploid genotype for each sample was reconstructed withpileupCaller(https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools) by performing a random allele call between bases from each site. Transition sites were removed to avoid taking possible false polymorphisms due to deamination linked to postmortem degradation processes into account in the analyses. bcftools mpileup pileupCaller Biological sex was estimated by calculating the ratio of sequences aligning to the X and Y chromosomes.72 In order to determine the Y chromosome haplogroups of males, genotypes of individuals were called usingbcftools mpileup64with mapping and base quality \u226530 overlapping Y chromosome SNPs (Human reference genome hg19). Y chromosome haplogroups were then assigned using the yhaplo software (Identifying Y Chromosome Haplogroups:https://github.com/23andMe/yhaplo;57).

The READ method (Relationship Estimation from Ancient DNA20) applies a non-parametric approach by calculating and normalizing a mismatch rate across the whole genome on pseudo-haploid data to infer the degree of relationship for each pair of individuals. Instead, the TKGWV2 method (Thomas Kent Genome-Wide Variants 221) uses genome-wide variants and allele frequencies to infer the relationship between a pair of individuals. This software was run using population allele frequencies from current European populations (CEU from 1000 Genomes, phase 3), which were provided with the software. The third method used in this study (KIN), infers relatedness of pair of individuals based on the identical-by-descent segments they share, and it can classify up to 3rd-degree relatives and differentiates siblings from parent-child pairs.22Results are considered as significant for a Log Likelihood Ratio >1. Input files for KIN from bam files were generated with the script KINgaroo provided by the author. The default parameters were used, and no contamination correction was applied. The pseudo-haploid data reconstructed for BSS samples were then merged with previously modern and ancient published genomic data reported in the dataset of David Reich\u2019s lab (v50.0, 1240K),23which include data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Phase 3.74All duplicates and possible related individuals were removed from the dataset. Moreover, only data from individuals classified as \u2018PASS\u2019, with a minimum coverage \u22650.01 and with more than 5000 SNPs were kept for comparative analyses.

To compare the non-linear variability of each leg between the two groups, we compared the SampEn of peak acceleration and peak angular velocity using Mann-WhitneyUtest. To compare the structural complexity of barcoding states, we used independent-samplest-test. The differences between two legs in each group were tested using paired-ttest. We also compared the proportion of each barcoding state between the two groups using Mann-WhitneyUtest. We did not adjust the significance level since this is an exploratory analysis.

We analyzed the pain intensity of different MIA doses including 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg as they were commonly used in the studies. Also, we analyzed the pain trajectory after MIA injection and conducted an analysis by dose and time in order to see whether the pain trajectory differ by dose. The analysis was not carried out in MIA 4 mg group due to the insufficient sample size. To quantify the pooled effects of the primary outcome, we used standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) according to the results of WBD (ipsilateral/total\u00d7100%) and PWT that were used to measure the pain. As there was significant heterogeneity regarding the methods used for scoring among the papers included in the meta-analysis, data were analyzed using a random-effect model. Moreover, we explored potential dose-response relationship between pain and MIA by using restricted cubic splines with three knots (25 50 75) in the dose-response regression model, and results from each study were then pooled together with the conventional meta-analysis.

For conducting the meta-analysis of SMD, data reported in median and interquartile range (IQR) or range was extrapolated into mean and standard deviation (SD) using methods suggested by Wan et al.27and Luo et al.28Given the variability in the population characteristics, IBD diagnostic criteria, and fecal S100A12 assay methods between studies, a random-effects model for the meta-analysis was primarily applied. Publication bias was assessed qualitatively using the funnel plot and quantitatively using Egger's regression test.29Sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method. DTA meta-analysis using a bivariate method was carried out to obtain the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic score, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (AUSROC) curve, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to detect the presence of a threshold effect. The threshold effect is one of the causes of heterogeneity in DTA meta-analysis, which arises owing to the variability of cut-off values \u200b\u200bused between the studies.
