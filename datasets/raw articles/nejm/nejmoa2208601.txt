Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to test the superiority of
semaglutide to placebo with respect to the pri-
mary end point and secondary confirmatory end
point with the use of a hierarchical testing strat-
egy (Table S1). Superiority with respect to the
primary end point (defined as a two-sided P value
of <0.05) was required before the secondary con-
firmatory end point could be tested. A sample of
192 participants provided 90% power to detect
superiority with respect to the primary end point
and 72% power to detect superiority with respect
to the secondary confirmatory end point.
Efficacy analyses were performed in the full
analysis population (all participants who had un-
dergone randomization) according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. Safety end points were
assessed in the safety analysis population (all
participants who had undergone randomization
and were exposed to at least one dose of sema-
glutide or placebo). Observation periods included
the in-trial period (the time from randomization
to the last contact with a trial site, regardless of
discontinuation of semaglutide or placebo or the
use of rescue interventions [i.e., other medications
for obesity or bariatric surgery]) and the on-treat-
ment period (the time from the first dose of sema-
glutide or placebo to 14 days after the last dose
for efficacy analyses, or the time from the first
dose to 49 days after the last dose for the safety
analyses, excluding any temporary interruptions).
For all estimated between-group differences,
two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calcu-
lated; P values are reported only for the primary
end point and secondary confirmatory end point.
Analyses of secondary supportive end points and
exploratory end points were not controlled for
multiplicity, and findings for these end points
should not be used to infer definitive treatment
effects. Statistical analyses were performed with
the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
