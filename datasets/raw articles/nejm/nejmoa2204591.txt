Statistical Analysis
Dose escalation and selection of the dose or
doses for a phase 2 study were guided by
modified continual reassessment methods.
These methods were based on a Bayesian logis-
tic-regression model and an overdose control
principle.28,29
Safety was assessed in patients who had re-
ceived at least one dose of talquetamab. Efficacy
was assessed in patients who had received at
least one dose of talquetamab, had undergone
at least one postbaseline disease assessment,
and had a response that could be evaluated.
Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and im-
munogenicity were evaluated in patients who
had received at least one dose of talquetamab
and had at least one sample that could be evalu-
ated after the dose was received.
In the analysis of response, the percentage of
patients with a partial response or better was
calculated with a two-sided 95% confidence in-
terval. Data were summarized with the use of
descriptive statistics. Additional statistical meth-
ods are described in the study protocol.
