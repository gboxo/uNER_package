Statistical Analysis
We calculated that 1055 primary-outcome events
would provide the trial with 90% power to detect
a 17.5% lower hazard for the primary outcome
in the chlorthalidone group at a two-sided alpha
level of 0.049, assuming a 3% annual incidence
of the primary outcome in the hydrochlorothia-
zide group. A planned interim analysis of the
primary hypothesis was performed after 500
primary-outcome events had occurred, with a
type I error rate of 0.01.
Primary analyses were performed with the
use of unadjusted log-rank tests that were strat-
ified according to VA health care system. Sec-
ondary analyses and analysis of the time to
hospitalization for hypokalemia were performed
with the use of a competing-risk model.15 Ad-
justed Cox proportional-hazards models were
also used for secondary analyses that were con-
trolled for age, sex, race, estimated glomerular
filtration rate (GFR), baseline diabetes, and his-
tory of myocardial infarction or stroke.5 Pre-
specified subgroup analyses were conducted
with the use of baseline data with regard to
median age, race (Black or non-Black), estimated
GFR (<60 or â‰¥60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of
body-surface area), sex, presence or absence
of diabetes, history of myocardial infarction or
stroke, and median systolic blood pressure.
Because the statistical analysis plan did not
include a provision for multiplicity when tests
were conducted for secondary or other out-
comes, results are reported as point estimates
and 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the
confidence intervals were not adjusted for multi-
plicity, so intervals should not be used in place
of hypothesis testing. All the analyses were per-
formed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4
(SAS Institute).
