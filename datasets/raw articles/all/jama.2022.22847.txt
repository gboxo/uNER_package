Statistical Analysis
Characteristics between participants with and without ADPKD
were compared using unpaired t tests for continuous vari-
ables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables (Table 1).
For genotype-first analyses, Firth logistic regression was used
to assess associations between carriers of LOF variants of each
gene previously linked to cystic kidney or liver disease with
ADPKD ICD-9/10 diagnosis and, secondarily, any kidney or liver
cyst diagnosis.21 The reference group included participants
with no LOF or rare (allele frequency <0.01) missense vari-
ants in any genes related to cystic liver or kidney disease. First-
and second-degree relatives in the cohort were removed in
these analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, and the first
10 genetic principal components and performed using the
firthlogist Python package, version 0.5.0 (see eFigure 4 in
Supplement 2 for flow diagram). A 2-sided P < .05 was con-
sidered statistically significant with Bonferroni adjustment for
multiple comparisons. In phenotype-first analyses, compari-
sons of proportions with a rare variant in 1 of the 11 genes re-
lated to cystic kidney or liver disease by presence (vs ab-
sence) of family history and ADPKD phenotype (typical vs mild
or atypical) were examined using a 2-sample test of propor-
tions; these analyses excluded patients who lacked sufficient
clinical data to confirm ADPKD. For phenotype-first analy-
ses, a 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant
