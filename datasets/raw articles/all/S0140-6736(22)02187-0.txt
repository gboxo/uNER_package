Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS software (version 28) and
descriptive statistics were reported. Aggregate and
deidentified data are presented to avoid deductive
disclosure of the identities of individuals with monkeypox
virus infection. During the analysis, data from the five
non-binary individuals assigned female at birth were
grouped with data from cis women (forming a category
of people assigned female at birth) as the numbers were
too small for meaningful comparison.
