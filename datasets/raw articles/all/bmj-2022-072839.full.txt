Statistical analysis
For all six tests, each biscuit variety was ranked based
on median and mean scores, with a score of 1 (ranked
first) assigned to the biscuit with the best result and
a score of 4 (ranked last) assigned to the biscuit with
the worst result. We added the scores for each test
together, with each test given equal weighting in the
scoring process. The biscuit with the lowest overall
score was thus considered the best biscuit.
