Statistical Analysis
Absolute and relative weight changes were compared by
group using t tests. The primary hypothesis that the diet
and exercise group would have a reduced WOMAC pain
score at 18 months compared with the attention control
group was tested using a 2-tailed significance level of .05
using contrast statements from a repeated-measures mixed
linear model with time (6, 12, and 18 months), randomiza-
tion group (diet and exercise vs attention control), and the
interaction, with additional adjustment for baseline values,
body mass index, county, and sex using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc). Similarly, repeated-measures analysis
used mixed linear models to analyze prespecified secondary
outcomes of body weight, waist circumference, WOMAC
function score, 6-minute walk distance, pain medication
use, and Short Form 36 physical and mental subscales. Each
outcome was modeled separately with adjustment for base-
line body mass index, sex, county (site), and baseline values
of the outcome, and 18-month effectiveness tested based on
a 2-tailed significance level of .05. Analysis of outcomes
included patients for whom data were available at 1 or more
follow-up time points. To account for missing data, pre-
specified sensitivity analyses were conducted for all
patients using multiple imputation methods for missing
observations based on baseline data and, when available,
follow-up data assuming missing data were missing at ran-
dom. Because of the potential for type I error due to mul-
tiple comparisons, findings for analyses of secondary end
points should be interpreted as exploratory. The half-SD for-
mula was used as a proxy to calculate MCII and MCID values
when empirical values were not available.24
Post Hoc Analyses
Comparisons between participants who completed the trial
and those who did not complete the trial were performed in
post hoc analyses to identify factors associated with study
dropout. Repeated-measures Poisson regression was used
to determine the effect of the intervention, compared with
attention control, on the outcome of a WOMAC pain score
reduction of 2.0 points. This criterion was recommended by
the Osteoarthritis Research Society International as a mod-
erate intervention response on a 0- to 20-point scale, a rela-
tive improvement of 15% to 35%. 37 To assess whether
COVID-19 influenced the treatment effect, analyses were
repeated using data points collected before COVID-19
restrictions were implemented on March 16, 2020. Addi-
tional post hoc outcomes (PASE, CES-D) were analyzed with
mixed models similar to the prespecified secondary out-
comes, adjusting for the baseline values of each outcome.
Post hoc risk and relative risk for achieving clinically mean-
ingful (2-unit decrease) change in pain were modeled using
a generalized estimating equation model with contrasts for
group comparisons at 6- and 18-month follow-up, adjusted
for baseline pain scores. Scatterplots were created depicting
the relationship between weight loss and change in pain for
each group. Primary and secondary analyses were repeated
using intervention site as a random effect.

meal replacements; and by 18 months, 26% used meal
replacements (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Primary Outcome
At 18-month follow-up, the adjusted mean WOMAC pain score
was 5.0 in the diet and exercise group vs 5.5 in the attention
control group (adjusted difference, −0.6; 95% CI, −1.0 to −0.1;
P = .02) (Table 2 and Figure 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Between baseline and 18-month follow-up, mean body weight
changed by −7.7 kg (−8%) in the diet and exercise group and
−1.7 kg (−2%) in the attention control group (difference in ab-
solute change, −6.0 kg; −7.3 kg to −4.7 kg) (Table 2; eFigure 1
in Supplement 2). At 18-month follow-up, mean waist circum-
ference was 105 cm in the diet and exercise group compared
with 111 cm in the attention control group (adjusted differ-
ence, −5 cm; 95% CI, −7 cm to −4 cm; P < .001).
At 18-month follow-up, the mean WOMAC function
score was significantly better in the diet and exercise group
compared with the attention control group (mean score,
16.5 vs 19.8; adjusted difference, −3.3; 95% CI, −4.9 to −1.7;
P < .001) (Table 2). At 18-month follow-up, the mean
6-minute walk distance was 419 m in the diet and exercise
group and 376 m in the attention control group (adjusted
difference, 43 m; 95% CI, 31-55 m; P < .001), and Short Form
36 physical subscale mean scores were 41.4 in the diet and
exercise group compared with 37.6 in the attention control
group (adjusted difference, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5-5.2; P < .001).
