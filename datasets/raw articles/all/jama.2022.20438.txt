Statistical Analysis
Dichotomous outcomes were compared via Ï‡2 test. All ran-
domized participants were analyzed according to their
randomization group. The per-protocol analysis set included
all randomized patients who underwent a frozen embryo
transfer and had no major protocol deviation. Post hoc subset
analyses were performed: (1) including only those partici-
pants with nonreceptive endometrial receptivity results
(those for whom any adjustment in transfer timing was rec-
ommended) and (2) including only those participants for
whom endometrial receptivity testing recommended an
adjustment of at least 24 hours relative to standard timing.
Analyses were performed using the R statistical computing
system (version 3.6.3; The R Foundation). No interim analysis
was performed. A 2-tailed P value less than .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Because of the potential for type
I error due to multiple comparisons, findings for analyses of
secondary end points should be interpreted as exploratory.
