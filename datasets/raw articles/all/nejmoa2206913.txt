Statistical Analysis
We calculated that the pivotal cohort would need
a target sample size of 100 in order to provide
the study with 92% power to detect an increase
from 20% to 35% in the percentage of patients
with a complete response, at a two-sided alpha
level of 5%. The observed percentage of patients
with a complete response in the intention-to-
treat population (which included all the patients
enrolled in this cohort) was compared with a
prespecified value of 20% (for complete response
in a historical control), which was established
on the basis of a meta-analysis of 19 studies,
with the use of an exact binomial test.
All the patients in the main analysis cohort
who received obinutuzumab or glofitamab were
included in the safety population. We used the
Clopper–Pearson method to calculate 95% con-
fidence intervals for the percentages of patients
with a response. Kaplan–Meier plots were calcu-
lated for survival end points. The confidence
intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity and
should not be interpreted as hypothesis tests.
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary
end point were performed. Efficacy analyses were
performed in the intention-to-treat population.
Data were analyzed with the use of SAS soft-
ware, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). A data-cutoff
date of March 14, 2022, was used.
