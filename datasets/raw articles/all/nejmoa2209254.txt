Statistical Analysis
On the basis of an expected mean difference of
3 points favoring deferiprone in the change in
the MDS-UPDRS total score from baseline at 36
weeks (as reported in a trial of rasagiline involv-
ing persons with Parkinson’s disease21), a stan-
dard deviation of 9.0, and a 23% dropout rate,
we calculated that 372 participants in total (186
per group) would be sufficient to show superior-
ity of deferiprone over placebo, with a statistical
power of 80%. Efficacy analyses involved all
randomly assigned participants in their assigned
group according to the intention-to-treat princi-
ple with the use of a two-sided test with a sig-
nificance level of 0.05. The results for the pri-
mary efficacy outcome in the deferiprone and
placebo groups were compared with the use of
the constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA)
model (changed before the database was locked
from analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] in the
original protocol) including site as a random ef-
fect, from which the baseline-adjusted mean
difference at 36 weeks was estimated with a 95%
confidence interval as a measure of treatment
effect.22 All secondary and exploratory outcomes
were also analyzed with the use of the cLDA
model; in cases of deviation from normality and
when logarithmic transformation could not be
applied, the absolute changes between baseline
and the follow-up time point of interest were
calculated and compared between the two groups
with the use of nonparametric ANCOVA adjusted
for baseline values (standardized difference and
95% confidence interval).
For all clinical outcomes, primary efficacy
analyses were performed after multiple imputa-
tion for missing values, including for partici-
pants who withdrew from the trial, with imputa-
tion under a missing-at-random assumption, with
the use of trial group and the main baseline
characteristics. Imputation was performed with
the use of a regression-switching approach (chained
equations, m = 20 imputations), with a predictive
mean matching method for quantitative vari-
ables and logistic-regression models (binomial,
ordinal, or multinomial) for categorical vari-
ables.23 Treatment-effect estimates that were ob-
tained in multiple imputed datasets were to be
combined with the use of Rubin’s rules.24,25 Two
sensitivity analyses were performed, first by re-
stricting the analysis to available data and
second by imputing missing outcome values
with the use of the last observation carried for-
ward. For per-protocol analyses of the primary
outcome, leave-one-out site analysis (an un-
planned analysis to assess the site effect) and
prespecified subgroup analyses were performed.
An exploratory analysis was performed to esti-
mate and compare the slope of evolution in
MDS-UPDRS total scores with the use of a linear
mixed model with random coefficients. For un-
planned analyses, we estimated the cumulative
incidence of adverse events and dropouts for
aggravation of Parkinson’s disease using the
Kaplan–Meier method and comparing deferi-
prone with placebo by means of the Cox propor-
tional-hazards model (hazard ratio) after check-
ing the proportionality assumption using
Schoenfeld residual plots. Details are provided
in the statistical analysis plan, available with the
protocol at NEJM.org. Because there was no plan
for adjustment of the widths of confidence inter-
vals for multiple comparisons of secondary out-
comes, P values are not reported and no definite
conclusions can be drawn from these results.
Data were analyzed with the use of SAS soft-
ware, release 9.4 (SAS Institute).
