Statistical analysis
Linear mixed models were used to examine variances
in VO
̇ 2 and EE among participants across the different
walking styles. Alpha was adjusted using the
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. All
pairwise comparisons are reported as mean±standard
deviation, and with 95% confidence intervals. Pearson
correlations were performed to examine the relation
between body mass and EE expressed in kcal/min
during each of the three different walks.
