Statistical analysis
Primary analysis
The category “no citations” was used sparingly, so
we pooled the categories “no citations” and “below
average” citations for analysis. For each editor, we
calculated the number of manuscripts they assigned
to the correct citation category. We calculated κ
statistics (95% confidence intervals) for each editor,
using Fleiss-Cohen weights,22 as implemented in the R
package vcd.23 We calculated how often each editor’s
classification was “extremely wrong” (a highly cited
paper was estimated to have low citation potential or
vice versa). We compared editors’ ability to predict
citation potential for articles published in The BMJ
versus elsewhere. We assessed accuracy separately
for Research Methods and Reporting (RMR) articles, as
these are typically highly cited. To assess the editors as
a group, we calculated the mean percentage of editors
identifying the correct category per manuscript and
the number and percentage of manuscripts for which
at least 50% of the editors were correct.
Secondary analysis
Additional unplanned analyses included repeating the
primary analyses using cut-offs of >30 and >50 citations
to look at ability to predict the citation potential of
the most highly cited articles and using the outcome
of citations in the first two years after publication to
reflect the impact factor calculation.
